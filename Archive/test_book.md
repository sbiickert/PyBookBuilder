Jerin never knew his parents. He was still little more than a tiny, pink ball of flesh when he was carried out of Bent Forthouse in the arms of a Holy Guardsman. The corpses of his parents had hung with the rest of the Bentian people, decorating the walls of the keep. His eyes may have turned skyward as he passed underneath, the but the horrors above did not affect him, nor did they imprint themselves in his memory.

The leading elements of the *Sanctum Bellatori* had passed through the outer walls of the Forthouse in the early morning. The dim morning light had muted the flashing green and gold of the uniforms of the holy guard of Arnath. They were a dark mass of controlled violence and steel, directed to crush the dissidents in Bent. But no Bentian sentries had kept watch at the gates to spot them and raise a warning. Even if nonexistent sentries had rung the tarnished alarm bells, the gates in the outer walls had been rusted open for decades. The gates had stood open as the invaders approached and passed in. Once the forces of Arnath had blocked Bent Valley at the South end, the people of Bent had had nowhere to go. The army had trapped the residents against the sheer valley walls and forbidding teeth of the Barrier Range.

In some places, a few farmers and breeders mounted a frantic defence. In others, the people only cringed from the thirsty swords and pikes of the soldiers. Most died in their homes. In a matter of less than an hour, Bent went from being an independent forthouse to a charnel ground.

Until this day, Bent had been a trading partner of great worth to Arnath. Their brand even marked the hindquarters of some of the pacers that the army rode up the Bent Valley. For centuries, Bent Forthouse had nurtured and protected the stock that made the name famous. In both Arnath to the West and Rhed to the South, the name Bent meant pacers of great strength and stamina. The breeding success and trading ties forged over generations had permitted Bent a freedom that other villages in the Eastern Marches did not enjoy.

On this morning, the long history of independence and success meant nothing.

When the bells of the Keep tower had finally rung out, the vanguard of the army had already overrun the village and had entered the main gates of the Keep. The hundreds of men, women and children of Bent Forthouse were like sand washed away by a powerful wave. The Arnathians gathered the survivors together in the main square of the Keep. The bloodied, bruised Bentians had heard the final benediction of the *Bellatori Primus*. They had had a few moments to make their peace with Melior. Some had prayed to Melior. Some had clutched children, parents or loved ones. But one by one, the Guardsmen had run them through, spilling crimson on the flagstones of the square. Jerin's parents had been among them, as had been his elder sister, who had turned five during the winter.

Jerin did not escape from the thirsty blades by evading capture: he could push himself up onto his hands and knees, but no more. When the first Guardsman had broken into his family's cot, he had turned his head to see what had caused the noise. Being an infant had not saved him: seventeen babes bled out on that morning. He did not survive because of his looks: his blond, curled hair, was foreign to the Arnathians. It would only have emphasized his alien blood to them. It would have made his death easier, more just.

Jerin's survival had hinged on coincidence.

Jerin's parents had lived in a cottage on the West side of the village. Their home was small, with only one level and three rooms. The family had been inside, unaware of the approaching soldiers, when the sun had climbed over the eastern side of the valley. His mother had fed Jerin. The morning had only begun. The soldier who had burst down their door had found the mother, father and daughter in the main room. The Guardsman had cowed them and herded them into a corner next to the cooking hearth. But then, he had pushed open the door to the room where young Jerin was laying. By happenstance, at that moment the sun had put its first limb over the mountains to the east side of Bent Valley. It  cast a ray of light through the window that fell on Jerin. The baby's head had been lit in a golden corona as his eyes focused on the soldier's face.

The soldier had fallen to his knees. It was as though Melior himself had placed a finger upon the sleeping babe. He was a young man, but strong in his belief that Melior would touch the world and give signs to follow. While the soldier was kneeling, entranced by the vision, a second fellow soldier had roughly pushed past to grab the boy from his crib. The first soldier had risen, enraged that the vision had been violated. He brought the butt end of his sword to the base of his comrade's skull.

Jerin left his home in the arms of a soldier who had been sent to kill him.

The soldier, cradling the infant, left the cottage. Jerin's mother cried and screamed as her baby boy left in the arms of an invader. Others came later to take the rest of the family to the square where they met their end.

The story of the child singled out by Melior himself spread, until it came to the ears of the *Bellatori Primus*.  Rastus, one of the priests of the Order, had already removed his gauntlets and helmet. The battle was over, for what it was worth. He had been overseeing as his squads had been raising of the bodies of the slaughtered Bentians to decorate their walls. He wasn't enjoying the task, but orders were orders. Seeing the tiny bodies hanging from the walls along with the adults left a sour taste in his mouth. He had ordered that the young soldier be brought before him. The boy's captain had reported that the he had injured a squadmate.

Rastus told the soldier to explain himself, still clutching the babe. While he was young and of low rank, the soldier had met the *Bellatori Primus'* eyes. He spoke with a righteous fire. That flame heated his words and he spoke with an eloquence that he had never shown before in his life. The babe, he said, had been singled out specifically by Melior himself. He drew the sign of the bowl and brought his fist to his forehead as he said so. He explained that he had felt a warm presence in the room, and his actions had been guided as though by an unseen force.

The commander looked on the babe. He felt disgust at the pale, alien features. His blue eyes looked as though they were made of water. The hair, thin and curling on his scalp, was the colour of straw. He had never seen an uglier child. But in that repugnant face, the *Bellatori Primus* saw a chance to strengthen the hearts of his men.

He announced that Melior had spoken. "Blessed be Melior, who has singled out this boy as a symbol of the purity we have brought to this place. Our work to punish the heretics in this village was just and had his favour." The men raised fists and cheered.  Some of the men drew their swords and kissed the pommel. The unease and disgust that he had felt in his men melted away. Jerin had become a symbol.

So it was that Jerin was taken into the arms of the warrior priest and nestled against the golden crest on the green breastplate. Jerin, in the arms of the Guardsman, led the conquering army back out of the gates as they began their long march back to the West. When the army stopped each night, the men lined up for an opportunity to look on this miracle child and touch him.

In Victoria, the heralds announced the army's approach, and the bells of Victoria rang in joy at their return. But few of the citizens knew what the army's mission had been. Even fewer knew the reasons that the army had left to raze Bent in the first place. No one questioned it. The priests mouthed the words "impiety" and "apostasy" and no more was asked. Within a few short months, most had forgotten it at all. If any Bentians had made it out of the valley alive, those survivors made their way to other villages.

Some foolish few might have told of fleeing through the mountain paths, lucky to escape with the clothes on their backs and their skins whole. Those few were marked by Arnathian spies, and disappeared. The wise would live their lives on the outskirts of society, and never tell their story.

As for Jerin, once the army had returned to the walled city of Victoria, the commander had turned Jerin over to the priests of the Order. They were to do with him what they could. He had served his purpose.

## Acolyte: Age Seven

Jerin stood in line in the Hallows, holding the flickering candle, and added his high voice to the chorus. Above, the image of Melior glittered with flakes of gold in the paint and the multitude of voices rang from the high ceiling, echoing round in an etherial way. The older boys' voices filled in the lower register in a complex, four-part harmony. It rose and fell in the old language, which Jerin didn't understand, but he mouthed the words. The candle in his hands laid a soft glow on the white of his robe, the front embroidered with the image of the bowl and sphere. Eighty pairs of acolyte hands held eighty candles. Gilded lamps added more light, but the Hallows were always a place of half-light, deep under the Temple.

In the darkness of the Hallows, Jerin felt more comfortable than any other place. Here, shadows muted his unnatural colouring. His hair might not have been dark like the rest of the boys in the pew, but it didn't shine like gold, either. Jerin tried to avoid the sun when he could. The bright yellow glare and his watery blue eyes were like a flashing beacon, calling the older and larger boys to beat him up.

Pol, Jerin's best friend, stood next to him, holding his own little candle. Standing at attention like this, as they had been now for over an hour, was hard on Pol. Pol was always in motion. He had a fire inside him that seemed to Jerin like it always pushed Pol forward. Pol was short for his seven years, and Jerin could see right over the top of his head to the next boy in the row. But Pol had dark hair and eyes, just like all the other boys.

Jerin snapped his eyes back to the front when he realized his attention had wavered. His next note was sharp as his throat constricted at the thought that Q'docet might have seen him turn his head. The sour note did draw the priest's eyes, but Jerin was looking straight forward and continued to sing with the rest of the boys. He regained his focus and the notes flowed cleanly now. Jerin did his best to not imagine the darkened furrow of Q'docet's brows as he scanned the row of acolytes looking for the one who had missed the note.

Jerin had felt the consequences for stepping out of line, as had all the boys here. There was a cane in Q'docet's study that hung above his holy book. Each boy had needed the comfort of the others on more than one occasion after returning, weeping from a session in the priest's office. No one spoke of what happened there, but each understood that time alone with Q'docet was to be avoided at all costs.

The hymn came to an end, with the last note dying as it swirled around the statues of the archangels that lined the walls. All the hosts of Melior, the glorious and the fallen, looked down on the acolytes, holding their little lights against the dark. Levifid, the wise counsellor with his grey hair, lined face and deep eyes was there. Sicaria, the avenging angel, with her sword of might, there also. The first of the priests of the Order, smaller images of men in white with glowing eyes stood nearby. There were over a thousand years of tradition and history in the Temple and Jerin was the smallest part of that.

The Hallows were deep in the bedrock under the Temple of Melior. Jerin knew, as all the acolytes knew, that the actual bowl and sphere of Melior, the bowl that catches the blood of the pure, lay just beyond. There were thick doors he and the others could see beyond the dais and the priests there. The Artifact, the prize possession of the Order, was in that room. Only on a few occasions were the acolytes allowed this near, and the beauty and power of the place made Jerin feel very small.

"*Postero canticum placet*," came the tenor voice of Q'docet. He raised his right hand, and as one, the fifty voices of the acolytes brought forth the opening words of the fifteenth hymn. The fifteenth was Jerin's favourite. He understood only some of the words, but the song made him feel like he was flying up, up, above the smokes that rose from the City. He could see clear skies and mountains tipped with white, and a clear day dawning.

It was as he was enjoying the rousing chorus when he saw two points of light. They were peeking from behind the dais at the head of the hallow. They were eyes, and they disappeared almost as soon as he has seen them. In fact, they disappeared so quickly that he wondered if his eyes were tricking him. *Was it a spirit? Something drawn from the bedrock of the Earth by the beauty of the music?*

The shock of seeing those eyes, behind the priests on the dais, threatened to constrict Jerin's throat again. He was shaken, but he managed to stay in tune and in on tempo this time, so the priest's eyes did not seek Jerin out. While all the boys had felt the rough side of Q'docet's hand, Jerin and Pol had felt it more than most. Pol attracted trouble like a white acolyte robe attracted stains.

There were eighty acolytes in the temple from ages six to seventeen. Not all were graced with fine features or symmetric faces, strong shoulders or kind mouths. But there was only one face in this room who everyone called ugly. The fact that Jerin was ugly was never in doubt. When priests or acolytes or healers  mentioned it, it was only a statement of fact, without one drop of additional malicious intent implied. His blue eyes drew gasps of disgust when he was outside the temple. His blond hair stood out from the sea of brown like a gull among crows. Q'docet was cruel to all the boys, but he harboured a special malice for Jerin.

Jerin could understand the revulsion. He did not know why he was so different, but he too felt revulsion when he caught his reflection. Twice, when Jerin had been sent to haul ashes from the kitchen hearth, he had rubbed them into his curling hair. For a short while, the ash dulled his yellow hair to a colour near to everyone else, but when Q'docet had found out, it meant a trip to the study.

"You are marked," he had breathed as he let a weeping Jerin leave the room. "You are marked as surely as the brands upon the forehead of Reas the Damned." His hand traced the sign of the bowl and he brought his fist to his forehead. "Go forth and let the people see you and shirk in horror at you. You are loved as an acolyte of the Order and hated as one disfigured. Blessed be Melior."

"Blessed be Melior," Jerin had said with a quavering voice. He had tried it once again later, but the severity of the punishment had broken something in him. He accepted his deformity now. Some of the other boys seemed to be able to look past it. Pol was one of the few who took it in stride.

"You're ugly, and I'm short," he had said once. "We freaks have to look out for each other, 'cause no one else will." Jerin didn't have words to express how it felt to have at least one person who accepted him. But having only the smallest boy in the temple on your side was cold comfort when the largest ones were bored. Pol was fast on his feet and fast with his tongue. He could talk his way out of a lot of things, and could run when that failed.

The ceremony continued, until the last hymn ended and Q'docet led the boys in file out of the Hallows. They walked in a long, winding queue through the echoing corridors that led away from this holiest of places.

The youngest were the last to exit. Jerin watched the right end of the dais for a reappearance of the bright eyes. The shadows webbing the dais could have held a dozen spirits in their depths. There was nothing to see and the eyes did not reappear. Once the Orders of elder acolytes had filed past, if was his turn to follow Pol from the room.

It was three days later when Jerin saw those eyes again. This time it was in the Library. It was the afternoon period, when the Tenth Rank was set to memorizing the Words of Melior. There were many writings of Melior, but the youngest of the Order memorized the core of his teachings and recited them before the breakfast meal. Pol had been the speaker yesterday, and that meant that in three more days, it would be Jerin's turn, and he was not nearly as good at memorizing as Pol was.

There were six boys in the Tenth Rank, and Jerin sat with them. They sat in ladder backed chairs around low tables, each with a copy of The Words of Melior open in front of them. Pol sat next to him, as usual. Pol wasn't reading, but was balancing a brass coin on the back of his fingers, shifting it from knuckle to knuckle. Pol had memorized The Words of Melior word-perfect already. On the other side of Pol was Feri. His head was down on the pages in front of him. Feri couldn't read very well, and he acted out when they had their reading sessions. Today, he was refusing to even pretend to read. His dark, curly hair curtained his face.

Across the table sat Ayb, and beside him was Hume. Ayb was all right, but Hume had taken it on himself to make Jerin's life miserable. He had a thin face, and his dark eyes were too close together. His mouth was normally a mean line, when it wasn't curled in a smirk. If Jerin could have stayed away from Hume, he would have. But each Order worked and lived together in the Temple. And Jerin and Hume were both in the Tenth, and Melior didn't listen to the prayers of acolytes who wished for Order reassignments.

Ayb was thickset, where Hume was thin. He had a round face. He wasn't mean like Hume, but he did spend the most time with Hume, and never seemed to think for himself. Jerin didn't think he was a bad person, but whenever Jerin, Ayb and Hume were together, Jerin felt outnumbered.

The sixth boy at the table, Jakab, was fidgeting. He hated sitting still for any reason, and had spent lots of time in Q'docet's study because of it. He had a birthmark that crossed his right eye socket, giving him a strange look. There was a rumour that his parents had given Jakab to the Temple because they were certain that it was a mark of evil. Jerin didn't think that Jakab was evil, although he did act as though he was possessed by energetic spirits most of the time.

The words of the book were small and cramped on the rough paper. The books had a strange smell to them, like something dry and rotted. They always read the same book, over and over again. Some of the stories in The Words of Melior were good, like the thirty-sixth passage: the battle of the Dusha. But memorizing the stories instead of only reading them sucked all the fun out of them. They had been memorizing the book for over a year now. Sometimes, Jerin looked around at the tens of thousands of books on the shelves in the Library, and wondered what was in them. There were some days when the priests used the boys to fetch books for them. Jerin always volunteered for that job: he read the titles longingly when he could understand the words. Many were in High Cleric and he only knew his memorized songs and prayers in that language.

Hume scratched at a bit of paper with a quill. They all had notes on the Words they were memorizing. The thin boy dipped his pen into his pot of ink, but instead of tapping the excess on the side of the pot, Hume flicked his pen at Jerin. In horror, Jerin saw three black spots appear on his white robe. Instinctively he tried to wipe the ink off, but it smeared.

"Hume!" Jerin hissed. Jerin made a motion to get up, but the voice of the Eldest rose from the far end of the Library.

"The acolytes will be silent in the Library."

Jerin froze at the words, then settled back in his chair, staring at the stain. It would be hours of scrubbing to get that out. He glared at Hume, who met it with a silent smirk from across the table. Jerin almost rose again, but Pol's hand on his arm stilled him. It would do no good.

Angry, Jerin's eyes bored holes in his copy of the Words without reading them. He could imagine the harsh words he would receive from the Eldest when he noticed the black marring Jerin's robes. There was a chance it would mean a trip to Q'docet's study. He felt a sense of helplessness grow to replace the anger. There was nothing to do about it.

Jerin was staring towards the shelves, tapping his page and wishing the stains would go away, when the eyes appeared again. This time, they appeared from around a corner of one of the rows of books. They were dark and set in an oval face, framed by dark, long hair. It was a girl's face. Her eyes were fixed on him, with an intensity that seemed to freeze Jerin in place. Heat of embarrassment rose in Jerin, as it did every time he realized someone was staring at him. Ink stains were forgotten. Yet another person was staring at his eyes and his hair. Immediately, Jerin hunched down and looked away.

When he looked back, the eyes were still there. The girl was still looking at him. The look on her face was not revulsion, but it was a stare that was unbecoming for a girl. Jerin had only seen a few girls, ever. They were not allowed in the Temple. On the few occasions that the acolytes were allowed outside, he had seen them, usually dirty and playing in the alleyways that twisted into the shadowy, unknown depths of the city. Jerin could clearly remember the first time he had seen a girl. Pol had had to explain to Jerin what they were.

"They are like us, but they... uh... don't have one of these.., he said, vaguely waving towards his crotch. "They grow up to be women." Jerin had flushed when he realized what Pol was getting at. He had lain awake that night and many nights after wondering how girls would pee without the necessary equipment.

Women weren't allowed in the temple either, but Jerin understood that they had babies and took care of families. Jerin supposed that he had had a woman as a mother, but he wasn't sure. Many times since, he had wondered if he had had a mother and if so, what she had been like. Someday he might find out.

Now there was a pair of girl's eyes staring at him from a girl's face in the Library of the Temple. Jerin's self-consciousness gave way to curiosity as she disappeared from view, back into the depths between the rows of books. He looked around to see if anyone else had noticed her. No one had, because none of the other five boys had reacted.

There was a motion from the other side of the Library, opposite from where the face had disappeared. Jerin's head swivelled to the motion, but it was only the Eldest, Gerard. Gerard wasn't in the Tenth Rank, he was older, and in the Seventh. The youngest acolytes weren't allowed to be in the Library unsupervised, but it was rarely a full priest that watched them. Gerard had pulled the duty to watch Jerin and the others for the period.

Gerard looked up from his book, but did not look in the direction of the boys' table, nor across to the rows where the girl had disappeared. Jerin watched as the Eldest looked down the hall for a moment, then seemed to make a decision. The older boy stood and walked down the main hall of the Library, and knocked on the door of the study of the Library's Keeper of Records. After a moment or two, the boy opened the door, entered the study, and it closed after him.

Jerin's eyes returned to where the girl had been. There was no sign of her. The aged covers of books with their creased and cracking leather and the worn and polished boards of the floor were there, but nothing that hinted of the girl who had appeared and disappeared again. Jerin bit his lip for a moment, but couldn't stop himself. Quietly, he slipped off his chair and walked towards the row.

Pol moved to stop Jerin, perhaps thinking he was going to exact some revenge on Hume, but was not fast enough. Pol caught Jerin's eye, but Jerin didn't stop. He walked as though it was the most natural thing for him to be doing. He knew the other boys were watching him, but without the older acolyte in earshot, none of them spoke up. Jerin asked himself what he was doing. If Gerard came back out from the Keeper's study and saw him, he might get away with only a scolding. But there was a chance that Gerard would hand him over to Q'docet. The thought made Jerin shiver.

There was no sound of the study door opening. There was no shouted command to stop and return to the table. In a moment, Jerin was somewhere he had never been: in the narrow passage between the huge stacks of books. It was dark and constricted. It almost looked like the shelves on either side would fall inwards and crush him. For a moment, Jerin felt as though he couldn't breathe, but he fought off the feeling. There was movement in the dimness of the far end of the passageway between books. There was a figure there, small, like he was.

He moved towards it. The girl was there, her thin arm outstretched and her hand touching a green book on the shelf. Her hair was somewhat wild, and her dress was mostly shapeless, and made of a rough material. It was an off-red, dark like blood. It had fallen back and away from her outstretched arm. Her pale skin seemed to glow in the gloom. Jerin had no way of knowing for sure, but the girl looked about the same age as him.

She was unaware that he was there.

"Hi," said Jerin in a whisper, not sure what to say. The girl dropped her hand from the book and turned to face him. She looked at him with that same intent stare. Even though he had surprised her, Jerin didn't think she looked scared. Jerin wondered anew why she was in the Temple.

"You was readin'," she said. It wasn't a question, but Jerin nodded.

"All of these books the same?" she asked, breaking her stare and looking at the walls of tomes surrounding them. Her voice was clear, but coloured with the accents that Jerin had heard on the streets of Victoria. She slurred some of the sounds, like no one had ever taught her to make them right.

"No," said Jerin. "Every one is different. You can see, they have names on the spines." She moved closer to the shelves, and leaned close to the green book she had been touching earlier. It had words in white ink on the spine, but Jerin was too far away and the light was too bad to read it.

"I wish I could read it," she said.

"Yeah, the light is bad. If we had a lamp…"

"I wish I could *read* it." She emphasized the word. It took Jerin a moment to understand what she was saying.

"You can't read?" he asked. The girl shook her head, making her unkempt hair move around, brushing the shoulders of her dress in a way that fascinated Jerin. He had never seen long hair up close.

They heard the muffled sound of a door closing, somewhere away in the Library. In a shock, Jerin realized where he was, and that Gerard was probably wondering why there were only five boys instead of six at the table. More importantly, Jerin knew he was in the stacks, where he definitely wasn't supposed to be.

"You need to leave," said Jerin, but the girl was already scampering away. He took a step to see where she was going, but she dodged around another stack of volumes, and was out of sight.

"Acolyte!" Jerin jumped. When he turned, he a saw Gerard, storming down the row. "Why are you here?"

"I... I…" Jerin stammered. " A thought struck him. "I saw a spirit, Eldest." Immediately, Gerard's expression drained of anger and was replaced by fear. "It was down here, but it only disappeared now."

Gerard grabbed Jerin's arm. It hurt, but Gerard was not trying to be cruel. He was dragging Jerin back towards the stronger lights of the area where the others waited. "I had heard that there were spirits that lingered in here," he breathed, his eyes darting as he backed away.

Jerin looked too, if only to see that the girl had gotten away without being seen. He wondered anew how she had gotten in here. They were in the Library, which was near to the southern side of the Temple, but there was no chance that she had wandered in. When they stumbled into the light, Gerard was still pale and Jerin could feel a tremor in the hand that was gripping his robe. Everyone had gotten to their feet. The Eldest noticed the attention, and composed himself.

"Return to the dorm," he said. "Study time is over for today. I am taking Acolyte Jerin to Q'docet." Ice appeared in Jerin's stomach. There were looks of sympathy on the faces of the others, but also understanding. There was no reason for wandering off, and Jerin had been caught. Pol began to raise a hand in the start of a gesture that might have been to comfort Jerin, but it fell back down and he started gathering his book and paper with the others.

Gerard yanked on Jerin's arm again, and started striding towards the main doors of the Library. Jerin was skipping along the wooden floor, barely able to keep up. He used the few curse words he knew under his breath. He hadn't escaped the visit to the priest's study after all. The ink stains, forgotten for the moment, returned to his memory. He swiped at them uselessly with his free hand, but they were not going to disappear.

It was only a short walk from the Library to Q'docet's study. He and the other priests who were responsible for the acolytes each had a small, airless room, made even more cramped by the rough assortment of furniture, relics and teaching tools arrayed inside.

Gerard knocked once, and made the bowl and fist. Jerin looked up at the face of the boy who had brought him here. Gerard still was not angry. In fact, he looked as nervous as Jerin felt. He fidgeted as he waited for Q'docet to answer the knock. He let go of Jerin's arm and straightened his robe.

When Q'docet answered the door, outlined by lamplight from the study, he did not ask for a reason for the intrusion. He looked at Gerard and at the much smaller form of Jerin. It was not unusual for an Eldest to bring a younger acolyte to his door. His eyes fixated on the stains on Jerin's robe, but he showed surprise when Gerard began to speak.

"*Saluto*, Magister," Gerard said. "Acolyte Jerin saw a phantasm in the Library."

Ready to comment on the ink stains, Q'docet's mouth opened, then his face showed confusion.

"A what?"

"A... a spirit, *Magister*. An apparition."

"When?"

"Just now. It fled when I approached."

"Did you see it?" the priest asked.

"Not very well," said the Eldest. Jerin did his best to keep his expression still. He knew very well that Gerard hadn't seen anything at all. "It was small, and reminded me of the wisps of fog that escape from the fields in the dawn." Jerin looked down so that his face hid from the priest. If he laughed now…

"Very well, you many go, but I will be speaking to you of this later."

"*Robur per fidem*," said Gerard as he cast his eyes down and turned to leave. Jerin turned as well, but the voice of the priest stopped him.

"Not you, Acolyte Jerin." Q'docet opened the door of the study wider and Jerin knew he was being invited in. The ice was back in his stomach, and Jerin turned back to face the open door to the study. Jerin remembered every time he had been into this room. Pain had a way of imprinting itself in memories.

When the door closed, he assumed the normal position, standing in front of the priest's writing desk. Q'docet brushed past him, and Jerin flinched. The boy's eyes sought out the tools hanging behind the desk, like a tongue seeking a sore tooth. The cane was there: an arm's length of hardwood. It hung next to straps of various sizes. Once, when Jerin had earned his first strapping, he had breathed a sigh that the priest hadn't grabbed the big, wide one. The narrow one looked less harmful, but he had learned that the narrow one could cut.

Q'docet settled into his chair behind the desk, and placed his hands upon the smooth, dark wood surface. Jerin knew from close up that there were salt stains on the desk. "Now, tell me about this spirit, Acolyte Jerin." His face was completely impassive, but that was never a good sign. Q'docet never got angry or showed eagerness to hurt. "It seems that your unnatural eyes are drawing the unnatural to you."

Jerin did his best. He started with the description that Gerard had given. He tried to evade the questions of the priest, claiming he didn't get a good look and that he hadn't been there very long, but it did no good.

He found himself led to the penance room, where he was stripped and locked in the dark. "Pray that Melior protects you, if you can find the strength. For you evidently need to combat the evil that is in you and draws the spirits. *Robur per fidem*," were the priest's parting words. Then the door shut and Jerin was left to shiver in the dark.

When another priest let him out and Jerin could return to the dorm, Pol told him that he had been gone for a whole day.

"I'm going to be a warrior," boasted Ayb, as he whirled a stick around him like a sword. The acolytes were waiting in their dorm to be collected. It was the rest day, and there was to be a series of executions, followed by the sermon from the Temple. Each boy was dressed in his finest white silk robes, and the crest was crimson, to signify the season was approaching mid-summer.

Jerin had to admit that Ayb was probably one who would be successful in becoming one of the priests who led the *Sanctum Bellatori*. All of the boys of the Tenth Rank were nine, but Ayb was already larger than the rest of them, and bigger even than some of the ten- and eleven year olds. Jerin was unexceptional, in both height and strength, and Pol remained the smallest.

Hume spoke up and claimed that he was going to be the head of the Order someday. His thin mouth was curled unpleasantly when he said it. His claim surprised no one. Hume adored the Order, and had expanded his hobbies from tormenting Jerin to reporting any other boy when they had broken the rules. Jakab and Feri shared a look that Hume didn't notice. He never did.

One by one, the other acolytes took turns claiming what they would become. As they had gotten older, each had gotten more chores to do, but also more freedoms. Some of the most responsible had be even been permitted to become runners, taking messages between the senior members of the Order and even outside the Temple. There were still eight years to go before they would be anything more than acolytes, but that didn't seem quite so far away any more.

When it was finally Jerin's turn, he mumbled something about perhaps becoming a theologian. He liked his time in the Library, and the debates that he had heard among the clerics there had seemed like something he would like to take part in.

"You've no hope, straw-head," said one of the older boys who was near to the door. It was Nico, of the Ninth Order. He was dark of eye and hair, just like all of the others. "You'll draw the worst jobs forever."

"Yeah, you'll be cleaning the lavatories," said Shay, the skinny boy standing with Nico. Shay had an unfortunate hook nose that dominated his face.

"Surgeon," chimed in another.

"Executioner," said a third. With each new probable future being listed, Jerin's breathing shortened and his heart raced faster. He clenched his fists and closed his eyes. Inside he swore that he would be strong. Melior would only help the strong. Jerin felt a hand on his arm, and opened his eyes enough to see Pol there, with a hand lightly restraining him.

"Maybe he'll end up an executioner," Pol said. "Makes me wonder if he might be the one to take my head from my shoulders one day." He said it in such a sincere, thoughtful way that it brought the other boys up short. "Or any of us, for that matter. Makes you think, doesn't it?"

There was an uncomfortable silence before the other boys started laughing again. But now it was forced, and a little more uncomfortable. They were turning away now, bored of teasing the ugly kid.

Pol winked and gave his trademark grin. Jerin tried to return it, but inside he was cursing his face and his hair. He didn't feel any different that the other boys, but no matter how hard he tried, no matter how he made himself fit in, he never would. They were right: he would always draw the worst jobs. Like today, for example.

Q'docet came into the room. The acolytes dropped whatever they were doing and formed the standard two queues. N'patri, F'ortiter," he said. "To the front." Jerin and Ayb moved to comply. They were at the fronts of each queue. All eyes would be on them.

They set off, leaving the dorm and descending from the third level of the Temple to the main entrance hall. The Temple had grown over centuries, and the acolytes' dorm was in a newer section. But the route through the stone was a labyrinth of turns until they neared the Entrance Hall.

There were other orders there, each in the same queues. It was a sea of white robes and crimson markings. Dark hair topped every head, except Jerin's. On cue, Jerin and Ayb left the Eighth Rank and joined the priest administering justice for this day. He led them to the room off the hall that held the records of entry and exit, as well as a long, light-colored wooden box. The priest laid his hands on the box, which was a hand deep and a hand wide, but as long as Jerin was tall.

"*Quarite iustitiam in aeternum*," he intoned before unlatching the box and opening the lid. The boys could see the purple velvet lining the inside of the box. As one, they extended their arms at chest height and held their palms upward. Inside was a long, curving sword. It had a broad blade and a two-handed grip. Jerin shot a quick look at Ayb, who was looking at the weapon with a worshipful glow on his face. Jerin felt no such thing as the sword was lifted by the priest and placed into the boys' waiting hands. Jerin flinched as the cold steel rested on his palms. He was careful not to touch the cutting edge, which was keen, and notched in places from the number of times it had had to cleave through bone.

Holding the sword high, drums began a low, slow roll that paced them back into the hall and towards the doors. With a boom, the latches were thrown back on the great double doors, and two strong Rhedmen in chains heaved each door open. The light outside blinded Jerin momentarily as his eyes adjusted from the lamplight inside to the sun of the square. He couldn't shield them, for fear of dropping the his end of the long sword. Ayb and Jerin followed the Priest of Justice out into the light. Row on row of priests leading acolytes followed them from the Temple doors to the grand platform facing the square.

The square faced the Temple and the largest and finest of the buildings in Victoria ringed it. They closed in the open space already packed with the city folk. The walls of the city rose up higher, closing in the buildings of the city. There was a hum in the air, from the people packed there, and the beat of the drums set it to throbbing. Jerin was much more comfortable in the quiet of the Temple. Despite the number of the citizens of Victoria who were filling the square, there was a sharp line dividing the crowd from the priests. The citizens kept a respectful distance at all times.

The grand platform was there to the left, and the priest led them up the stairs that climbed it. The platform was faced with marble, and had many tiers of seats, which the acolytes were filling. But dominating the view was they giant basin on the platform. The basin was also marble, shallow, but fully twenty paces around. When Jerin stood next to it, the basin's top was below his waist. It had a broad rim, upon which was a block with worn shapes for stretching arms or necks.

A large marble sphere, the size of a large man's reach hovered above the basin. Steel rods, painted to blend as well as they could with the marble, suspended the sphere. It was an enormous replica of the Bowl and Sphere of Melior. The priests of the Temple guarded the original in the Inner Sanctum beyond the Hallows in the depths beneath the Temple. The chopping block was not part of the original, but it was important for these execution days. Jerin had never seen the original, but there were pictures of it in the books of the library. The Words of Melior mentioned the Bowl and Sphere in the last parable, as a sign that Melior would return, but never explained what it was. An Artifact of the time Before.

The drums led them on, up the stairs onto the platform, where he and Ayb waited at the side of the basin. From this vantage point, Jerin could see that the bottom of the basin was stained darkly. He looked out on to the crowd that had gathered. It seemed like thousands of people, their chatter building to a roar that was deafening. Was life in the city always this loud? He had never been allowed out to explore the city. The only times he left the temple was for these ceremonies.

The drums changed rhythm, and Jerin looked to see the condemned being led from the direction of the prison. Guardsmen flanked them in their green and gold uniforms. Steel was drawn, but none of the prisoners looked as though they would try to win free. They were malnourished and bruised to a man, and shambled, blinking in the morning daylight. Jerin's eyes darted to the block, and the places where the condemned would spill their blood into Melior's Basin.

Jerin breathed a short prayer that none of the condemned were only losing a hand. They were the worst. The executions were bloody, but there was no screaming and thrashing afterwards. Those who only lost a hand had to live with the pain.

Jerin had been to so many of these Justice ceremonies that the rhythm seemed second nature now. The Priest of Justice gestured for silence and then began the benediction. Most of it was in High Cleric; Jerin was getting better at understanding the prayers instead of mouthing the words. Melior had left Arnath, but left an imperfect nation behind with work to complete. Melior forged the foundation of a strong nation. He would return and would wish for a strong nation to exist still. The rest droned on. Jerin had to focus on his job of keeping the sword up and parallel to the platform.

Finally the Priest of Justice read the charges and each man was led to the block. Today there were only three. The first two were young, and seemed dazed, as though unbelieving that this was happening to them. The masked executioner dispatched each, and their heads rolled together in the pool of their blood at the bottom of the basin. The executioner, dressed in black robes without adornment, would rise from his marble seat, take the sword from the outstretched hands of the boys, and sever the head of the prone prisoner. The blade was then returned to the boys. Jerin was holding the blade end and Ayb was holding the handle, so the blood from the executed men dripped from Jerin's knuckles as he tried to hold the sword high without shaking.

The last man of the day was older, with hair and stubble that was grey. His eyes were red and bloodshot and tears leaked down his cheeks as he heard the charges against him. Before he laid his shoulders a neck and head on the block, he scanned the crowd, as though he was looking for someone. If he saw them, he gave no sign, and then his head too was rolling to rest in the bottom of the basin. The sword returned to Jerin's hands, and he and Ayb were led away as the priest chanted the final sermon.

Strangely, as Jerin stepped in time with the drumbeat down he steps leaving the platform, he had the sensation of being held and being gently rocked back and forth by strong arms. He always felt that after an execution.

That evening, Jerin was alone in the laundry. Dinner was over, and the other boys were now listening to the evening sermon in the Grand Hall of the Temple. He was not there, because he was doing his best to scrub the bloodstains from his fine robe. Even though he had done his best to hold the execution sword in the proper outstretched position, blood had gotten onto the sleeves and even the hem. Jerin held the cloth up in the lamplight to see if he had finally gotten the stains out. It had taken three rounds of soaping and scouring, but he could no longer spot any of the brown on the white of the silk.

There was silence in the dim room, except for the drip of water and the sound of the fabric moving as Jerin scanned it. The Temple was large and sprawling. No sounds from the Grand Hall could make it this far. Jerin was alone with the sounds of water and his own thoughts. Part of him wondered whose blood it was that he was scrubbing from this cloth and whether they had actually been bad people.

He jumped out of his skin when he heard the sound of a low cough behind him. Jerin whirled, dropping the cleaned robe to the laundry room floor.

"Oh, now you've done it," said the girl who stood there, looking at the rumpled white cloth. Jerin looked around to see if there was anyone else, but it was only the girl.

*This is wrong*, he thought. *Girls aren't supposed to be in the Temple.* He should have said it aloud, but his curiosity was warring with the rules.

It had been almost two years since the time he had seen that girl in the Library, but still he had thought about it. Questions about that day and who she had been and how she had gotten into the Library had never left him. With the way she had appeared and then disappeared so quickly, Jerin had begun to doubt his own memories. Now she was standing here, and again without any good explanation. It was the same girl; it had to be. It was the one who had been in the library. It Jerin was sure of it. Her hair was shorter, and combed this time, but she had the same eyes. She was dressed in a dark brown wool this time. It was belted high on her waist, coming down to below her knees. She was barefoot.

"You aren't a spirit, are you?" Jerin asked.

"What?"

Jerin reached out, hand shaking, and put his hand to the girl's chest. She felt solid, and as his hand rested, he could feel her heartbeat beneath her ribs. She was real. A real girl. She was a cent or two taller than he was, with the requisite dark colouring and an oval face. Realizing he was touching a girl, he jerked his hand back.

"I... what are you doing here?" asked Jerin. "How did you get in here?"

"I saw you today," said the girl, ignoring his questions. "You were holding the sword, weren't you?" The girl had a way of drawing out her vowels that distracted him, but when he understood the question, Jerin nodded. The girl bent down and picked up the fallen robe. "It's dirty."

It was. She held it out, and Jerin took it. The damp white cloth had picked up dirt from the stone of the laundry room floor. With a sigh, he put it back into the soapy wash water.  "Well, at least that's better than bloodstains," he muttered.

"What's your name?" the girl asked as she shifted around to stand on the opposite side of the basin.

Jerin was about to answer, but he decided that she hadn't answered his question, so he wouldn't answer hers.

"Your speaking is better," he said as he scrubbed.

"My what?"

"Speaking. Your accent. You don't have a strong street accent now."

"My da' has been teachin' me," she said. "Wants me to help in the shop someday." The accent was slipping back, with clipped sounds. "I speak the best o' my friends." She moved herself to across the washbasin from Jerin. "Why is your hair like that?"

Jerin flinched from the question. He kept his blue eyes on the wash water. "It just is," he said.

"Ain't never seen the like. It's pretty."

That made Jerin's eyes jump to the girl's face. He looked for a smirk or some other trace of sarcasm, but he didn't find any.

"They tell me that Melior marked me at birth. I'm forever different." Jerin mumbled the last.

"Do yeh have a name? What do they call yeh?"

"Jerin." He returned his eyes to the wash water, where he was doing his best to remove the new stains from the robe. He knew how people reacted to his light eyes.

"Jerin what?"

"N'patri," Jerin murmured. He dared to look up at her as he said it. The girl's eyes widened.

"Really?" she breathed. "Oh, how awful for you."

N'patri was not a common name, but its closest meaning was "Bastard". Jerin had asked the priests why that was his name, but they had never told him. No one had ever told him why he had been raised from a baby in the Temple. Most parents gave their children to the Order to be acolytes at age six. The acolytes knew their parents, and the Order even made allowances for them to visit their families twice per year.

Jerin had no knowledge of his parents. It wasn't any of the priests, since they didn't marry. No one else had ever claimed his parentage. He wondered sometimes if an unmarried woman or a widow had given him up to the priesthood. That happened sometimes, but even then the babe had a name, based on their known parent. Of the boys in the Eighth Rank, only Jerin didn't know his parents. Feri was one who had a widowed mother, but he wasn't surnamed Bastard.

"Forget it," Jerin replied.

"Nessa." Jerin looked up at her again. "That's my name. You didn't ask me."

*Nessa. Nessa of the eyes in the dark.* He wanted to ask why she was here, why she was talking to him. *Why are you not staring at my deformities?* His words failed him though.

Without any reply from Jerin, Nessa continued on her own. "I really wish my uncle hadn't had to die t'day, but that was the will of Melior, right?"

"Your uncle?" said Jerin.

"Yes. He was the third to die today. My mother's eldest brother." Jerin's hands clenched on the white cloth in the wash water. He had only finished washing her uncle's blood out.

Jerin tried to remember the charges against the third man. He had been the sad-faced grey-haired one. "I remember him. I can't remember what his charge was."

"Blasphemy," she said simply. "Or that's what they called it."

Blasphemy covered a lot of things in the eyes of the Order. "What did he do?"

Nessa's face tightened for a moment before she answered. "I heard my ma talking. She said that he ha' been in the Spring market tending his stall— he was a fruit seller, did I say tha'?" Jerin shook his head. "Anyhow," when Nessa said that, she made a waving gesture with her left hand, "cousin Abby was helping him, and he said that a priest had tried to take her."

"Take her? What for?" asked Jerin. She stared at him for a moment.

"For sex, you idiot," Jerin blushed. He only had the vaguest idea what sex was, but he knew that it was one thing that priests swore not to do when they accepted the robe.

"Why would you say that. The priests don't do that," said Jerin.

Nessa stared at Jerin for a moment. She looked sad. "They... never mind. Unc Dafe tried to stop him, and ended up being taken away by a troop of Guards. The next time anyone in my family saw him again was t'day." There was a hitch in her voice as she said that last.

"I'm... sorry," said Jerin. He didn't say it, but he thought that something was wrong with Nessa's story. It didn't make sense that a priest would try to take a girl... There were no girls in the Temple at all. And he wouldn't take one for... that. That would be unholy. A silence fell, and Jerin finished his wash. He ran the robe through the press, with Nessa watching him all the while. He was starting to get unnerved by her scrutiny. His face caused revulsion, not curiosity.

"Why are you here?" he asked again. "Did you come to see me? Because I held the sword for your Uncle?"

"No, silly. I couldn't stand the crying at home. And I wanted to see that Library again. I didn't know you'd be here."

"You wanted..." Jerin trailed off.

"To see the Library. I haven't been there since that time I saw you."

"You're a girl," said Jerin.

"You noticed."

"Why would you want to go to the Library? Girls can't read." There was a sudden silence. Nessa fixed him with a stare. Jerin had to look away.

"They can, too."

"But why are you in the laundry?" She gestured towards the door leading from the laundry to the linen room.

"That's the way into the temple. This," she gestured to the room, "was on my way."

She immediately turned and strode off in the direction leading deeper into the Temple.

"Wait!" Jerin called, in a voice he hoped wouldn't carry far. She didn't slow her pace, so Jerin pinned the damp robe on the drying lines, and hurried after her. He thought about what would happen if someone found her in the temple. He questioned what he was doing. *I should just let her go. If she gets caught, she gets caught.* There was no need to get tangled up in it. He had nothing to do with her being here. She'd said so.

By the time he'd reached the doors to the laundry, Jerin had made up his mind. He would return to the dorms and wait for the sermon in the Grand Hall to be over. He would follow the rules.

Jerin took a step in the direction to the dorms. But one step was all he took. He couldn't say why, but he turned his head to look back the other way. When he did, he glimpsed the dark brown of Nessa's dress disappearing around the corner at the other end of the hall.

So many thoughts tried to cram into his head at the same time. He couldn't keep them straight. He had so many questions about this strange girl. How had she gotten into the Hallows before? Why could she read? Why didn't she think he was ugly? Even Pol thought he was ugly, but was his friend anyway. He didn't want her to get caught. Maybe he could help her. He wanted to tell her how dangerous it was for her to be here.

These thoughts tied him in knots, still with only one step taken towards the dorm. He tried to remember how long it had been since the seventh bell. The others wouldn't be back at the dorm for a while yet. While he wasn't supposed to be wandering the Temple on his own, the Library was not out of bounds for an acolyte of his age.

Jerin took off after her. His heart was pounding and each step along the corridor had a spring of energy that he could never remember feeling. His soft shoes made a sound that echoed in the undecorated stone of this level of the Temple. It seemed so loud in his ears. When he reached the end of the corridor where he had last seen Nessa, there was no sign of her. She had disappeared again. *How did she do that?* he wondered. Was it magic? Some arcane skill that she had learned?

Jerin might not have known where Nessa went, but he knew the way to the Library. He hurried along the corridors as quickly as he could. He met no one along the way.

In the Library, he found Nessa again. She had to have taken a different route, because he hadn't seen her and she wasn't out of breath like he was. There were only a minimum of lamps lighting the huge space, so the light was dim and Nessa was barely more than a shadow standing halfway along the length of the room. She was standing and just looking up at the stacks of books.

"Isn't it amazing?" she breathed. "We can't afford many books at home." Jerin looked up at the stacks of books. He felt anew the reverence for the amount of knowledge that they represented. He had never thought of them as valuable in terms of money before.

"Are books expensive?" he asked. Jerin only had a rudimentary understanding of money. He could recognize the coins of Arnath, but he didn't have any money of his own. He had never had occasion to buy anything in his life.

"Da's been teaching me my letters, but we don't have much to read."

"We have to read every day," said Jerin. Then he was struck by an idea. "Wait here," he said, as he dashed back towards the doors, where the acolyte books were. Skidding to a stop in front of a low shelf, he selected one of the books there. There were several copies. Returning, he handed the book to Nessa. She took it reverentially. Her eyes were wide.

"What is it?" Her voice was barely a whisper.

"It's a basic reader," he said. "I was reading it the day we met." It was The Words of Melior, and it had a number of shorter legends which were used for children to learn to read.

"No," she said. She pushed the book back at Jerin.

"Why not?" Jerin asked.

"I like my hands attached to my arms. I'm not stealing nothing."

"It's not stealing. Consider it a loan," Jerin said.

"Will you get into trouble?"

Jerin considered it.

"Probably not. They won't notice it's gone."

At that moment, there were footsteps echoing from the passage outside the library. All of Jerin's confidence and excitement vanished instantly. He looked at Nessa, who shouldn't even be in the temple and here he was, giving her a book in the Library. They were trapped. In a moment, they would be seen. They couldn't hide in the library all night.

Jerin deflated, and reached out to take the book back, but Nessa grabbed his hand, and put a finger to her lips as she drew him into the row between two enormous shelves of books. Jerin thought about resisting. Would a trip to Q'docet's study be better or worse if he just came clean? He was sure that being found hiding in the Library with a girl would be worse. But Jerin found himself moving to follow.

Nessa moved with a quiet purpose. She did not look as though she was searching for a hiding place. She let his hand go as it was clear that he was going to follow. Her rough brown dress was difficult to see as they plunged into the darkness. The meagre light from the few lamps barely reached here. Just as Jerin was sure he wouldn't be able to see his hand in front of his face, the light in the room brightened. Someone had lit more lamps. Then the light took on a whiter hue. Someone had turned on the electric lights. That happened only when the most senior clerics were working at night.

Nessa's back was now clear, and she was bent over and moving quickly. Jerin redoubled his pace, careful not to make any more noise than necessary. He didn't know where they were going. There was only one way out of the library that he knew of. The girl stopped near to the end of the row. Without a pause, she started climbing a bookcase, holding onto the shelves as though they were rungs on a ladder. The shelf was massive, and didn't move or complain at holding her weight. Soon Nessa was higher than Jerin's head and heading higher. She looked down and saw him not following.

"Come on," she whispered. Jerin couldn't see an alternative, so began following. He looked up, and almost fell off the shelf. Nessa's dress wasn't made for climbing, and he could see her bottom. He lowered his eyes and just paid attention to where his hands and feet were going.

They reached the top of the shelf. Nessa motioned for Jerin to crawl onto the top, away from the wall. The shelf was tall enough to need a ladder to reach the top, and from this vantage point, Jerin could see an expanse of bookcase-tops, with a large open space in the centre of the room where the tables were. They were level with the upper windows on the southern wall, which were dark with the night outside.

However, it was very bright up here, where the electric bulbs were shining. There definitely were many people now moving through the library, and Jerin felt very exposed. Along certain lines of sight, he could see the floor level, and sometimes figures moved across them. All they had to do was look, and they would see his white robe. Jerin felt panic rising.

Jerin sensed movement behind him and turned  in time to see Nessa leap. It was almost silent, with her dress fluttering for a brief second and then her bare feet landing surely. There was an alcove in the wall of the library, and a gap between it the end of the bookcase Jerin was on. Nessa had cleared the gap in a blur of brown and then disappeared into the dark of the alcove.

It sounded like the voices of the people in the library were coming closer. There wasn't any time to search for an alternative action: it was leap or be found. Jerin raised himself to a crouch. The hight made him dizzy. He took a breath and then dashed the few steps to the gap. He jumped as hard as he could and got a sense of a yawning cavern beneath his feet as he flew over. He lost his footing as he landed, sprawling forward onto a smooth stone floor.

Hands caught him. He released the breath he'd been holding. It was dim here, but the light from the library was enough to see by. Nessa was there, and she was holding him, but she let go and stood up.

"Let's go," she whispered. They were in a narrow passageway, much narrower than even the lower passages of the temple. There were no lamps, but every once in a while, there was another doorway to the library and light leaked through.

"Where are we?" Jerin whispered.

"Servants' passage," said Nessa. They turned and moved into an airless corridor than intersected with the one they were in. The darkness closed on them, and soon Nessa took Jerin's hand to lead him in the dark. She knew her way, and she made several more turns, before the light started to grow again.

Jerin froze. There was a man up ahead, silhouetted in the light of a passage beyond. Nessa took another step before she realized that Jerin had stopped.

She chuckled. "Come on," she said. She tugged on his hand and urged Jerin into motion. As they approached, Jerin felt his face glow hot. It wasn't a man, it was a statue. They were behind the statue of Levifid, the archangel. Jerin knew where they were now. This was near the laundry; it was the same passage where Nessa had disappeared on the way to the library.

Nessa creeped forward, peering past the statue. There was no sound, and apparently she saw no one, for she moved forward let herself down and out of view. Jerin followed. The statue of Levifid was set high on the wall, and the only way down was by finding a foothold on the marble sconce that decorated the alcove. Jerin held onto the statue's ankle as he had seen Nessa do and soon he was down.

When they reached the laundry, they stopped. Nessa patted the bulge of the book under her blouse. He'd forgotten about it. "Thanks," she said simply, and leaned forward and planted a quick kiss on Jerin's unprepared lips. She whirled around and scampered into the laundry and through to the linen room. Jerin was temped to follow and see just how she got in and out of the temple that way. But he knew he'd pressed his luck as far as it would go this evening. He headed in the direction of the dorms. He hurried along the corridors, wondering how long he had supposedly been doing his laundry. He wondered if anyone would notice.

But more than anything else, Jerin was happy to finally know the answer of the mystery of the spirit girl from the Library. Her name was Nessa, and she treated him as though he was a person, not a freak. That brought a smile to his face. If his dorm mates noticed that Jerin was smiling when he returned from the drudgery of washing the blood from his ceremonial robe, they didn't mention it. Likewise, no one noticed when Jerin began volunteering for laundry duty more regularly.

## It Ends: Age Nine and a Half

Jerin eventually discovered how Nessa got in and out of the temple. The linen room had a chute that led down to the alleyway next to the temple. It was big enough for a person to get through, but it was a dark, claustrophobic crawl. The temple itself had thick walls like a fortress and this chute pierced it. Jerin also learned her family name: F'malth. Malth was her father, and he was a weaver in the city. Nessa was an apprentice, and was very good at embroidering, or so she said.

The one time that Nessa had led Jerin down to the alleyway through the chute, they hadn't gone as far as the shop where her family made their wares.

Jerin stood at the top of the chute, looking down into the black rectangle where Nessa's back had disappeared. He desperately wanted to follow. He could hear her scrambling down the stone surface. There was nothing else but the empty echoes in the linen room. He took a deep breath. The sharp aroma of the cleaning powders filled his lungs. Then he put a foot up onto the lip of the chute and hoisted himself into the opening.

Inside the tight confines of the chute, each sound he made seemed to echo back on him. Small rustles sounded like a rushing crowd. His heartbeat and breathing were loud in his ears. What was he doing?

There was a growing rectangle of dim light ahead. Jerin started to hurry towards it, sliding and scraping on the smooth surface.

He threw his legs out of the opening and pushed off with his hands. For a moment, he thought he might have misjudged the drop to the hardened clay of the alleyway, but then his feet hit the ground with a jarring blow. Nessa's hands caught Jerin's arms as he stumbled.

"Here we is," said Nessa. "Our shop is that way." She was pointing to the south end of the alley. The bulk of the temple rose over their heads on one side. It was a massive edifice of stone, towering three stories up, dwarfing the low building facing it across the alley. Looking up, Jerin could see the stars peering down.

A sudden dizziness took him. He was outside the walls. This might have been the first time that he could remember being outside for something other than the execution ceremonies. Even though the night sky was the same night sky that you could see from the open areas in the temple, it was different somehow. For all of the explorations that he and Nessa had done in the temple, they were in the temple. Being outside made everything more real.

He was going to get in trouble.

"Come on," said Nessa, oblivious to the churning sensation of guilt that was gripping Jerin.

"No," said Jerin. "I can't."

"Why not?" she asked, coming to stand in front of Jerin.

"I… just—" he couldn't put words to it. It felt like Q'docet was peering at them from every shadow. Jerin was struck by the sensation that he was about to lose control of his bladder.

Eventually, Nessa understood, and watched Jerin as he climbed back into the chute and into the temple. He was shaking and barely could grip the surface to crawl up.

Despite his misgivings, Q'docet did not discover that Jerin had been outside of the temple. Jerin had kept his head down in every lesson and made himself as small as possible.

He couldn't shake the feeling that he had sinned terribly. Every time he worked it through in his mind, he came to the conclusion that he hadn't. But that didn't cause the dirty feeling to go away. Whenever he had broken the rules in the past, there had been swift and painful repercussions. The priests would say that the punishment absolved the miscreant of the wrongdoing. This was something different: he had broken the rules and not been caught. It was starting to burn his soul.

He considered confessing to the deed, but he couldn't bring himself to it. The long, drawn-out pain of the sin was nothing next to the idea of a trip to Q'docet's office. However, Jerin did avoid the laundry for weeks afterwards.

As the days drew out, Jerin's misgivings about the incident started to fade. It was obvious that nobody had noticed the event, and nothing would ever come of it. In his prayers, Jerin added a silent vow that he would never be so foolish again. Something in that silent promise freed the constriction on his chest.

Soon, he was volunteering for laundry duty again.

Even with the excuse of attending the laundry, Jerin had been spending more time with Nessa than was wise. But at the same time, he was surprised at how much time he actually could find without Q'docet supervising or one of the Eldest noticing.

Jerin and Nessa found places other than the library to meet. It was surprising to Jerin to find that there were large parts of the temple were few people ever went. He and Nessa discovered them together: rooms and halls with dust thick on the floor, and open rooftops that were like massive play areas.

There were times when they had only just avoided running into either a priest or an acolyte, but each time, their newfound knowledge of the hidden ways of the temple were their means to escape. For the first time in his life, Jerin had a taste of freedom and joy, and he found he hungered for it.

Nessa hungered to learn. Jerin began smuggling books out of the library, giving them to Nessa when they met. She returned the books to him, and he placed them back in the library with no one the wiser. Sometimes he helped her with her reading, but usually they didn't risk a lamp. Jerin felt like an alley cat, prowling in the semi-dark. He and she were becoming masters of the secret ways of the temple.

Despite her enthusiasm, she still didn't read as well as he did, and he found himself reading much more than he did before. At night, they were exploring the physical confines of the enormous temple structure. In the day, Jerin was exploring the information that was hidden in the temple library.

Jerin should have realized that the only person who he couldn't hide his new extracurricular activities from was his old friend, Pol. The two boys had been inseparable since the day that Pol had arrived at the temple, and when Jerin started shifting his chores again and was hard to find some evenings, Pol noticed.

Pol confronted Jerin one evening. It was cold in the evenings, and the second coal stove in the dorm was being pressed into service. As he frequently did these evenings, Jerin was gathering the soiled clothing from the hampers for a trip to the laundry. He pushed the squeaking laundry cart between the rows of bunks, emptying each hamper as he went. The rest of the boys were entertaining themselves in the vicinity of one stove or the other, but not Pol.

Pol stood next to the doorway, leaning against the frame. He was watching Jerin and pushed himself away from the doorway and stood straight. "Laundry again, huh?" he asked. He said it lightly, but his eyes were sharp. Jerin consciously avoided his probing gaze.

"Yup." He kept moving, pushing the cart. Pol stepped aside to let him pass. But when Jerin did pass, Pol started walking alongside. Jerin didn't know what to do. He didn't want to ask Pol what he was doing, it would seem like he was hiding something. If Pol followed him to the laundry, who knew what would happen? Jerin didn't know if Nessa would show up this evening. Most evenings she didn't.

He decided to play it cool. They walked together in silence, Jerin pushing the cart, and Pol following. Jerin had to work to prevent the cart from wandering: its wheels weren't straight and the cart tended to move in unintended directions. They reached the main laundry chute that led from the upper levels to the laundry in the basement. Pol moved to grab the other end of the cart, and together they tipped its contents into the chute. Pol stuck his head into the dark chute and looked down.

"Do you ever consider sliding down?" he asked.

"No. Probably kill yourself landing in the basement."

"Huh. I've heard that laundry chutes are sometimes the most convenient way to get places."

Jerin froze for a second, then forced himself to relax. It had to be an offhand comment.

"Oh? Who said that?" asked Jerin.

"I don't remember. Oh well, let's go."

"Off to the dorm?" Jerin tried to keep the question casual. Pol just shrugged. He turned and headed in the direction of the inner staircase, which would lead down to the same place the laundry had just disappeared to.

They both entered the laundry. There was no one else here. They collected the clothes that had piled under the bottom end of the chute and carried them over to the large laundry machine. The temple was the only place in Lagroth that had such a convenience: along with the lights in the library, the temple boasted some other devices, like this laundry. It was slow and noisy, but it could churn a huge tub of clothes or other items in a basin of soapy water for hours and not get tired.

Most of the time that Jerin spent on his laundry errands was waiting while the huge machine did its work. It still was a manual process to wring the cleaned clothes and you had to wait for that. Of course, that gave Jerin long windows of time to sit and wait to see if Nessa showed up.

Pol marvelled at the contraption as Jerin got it moving. The noise was impressive as well. "GOING TO HEAD BACK?" shouted Jerin. Pol shook his head and from a pocket, he pulled out a deck of game cards. He motioned with them to one of the tables that sat in the waiting room just off the main laundry room.

He didn't wait for a response. He headed over and turned up the wick on a lamp until there was enough light to play and then he sat down and started shuffling. Jerin spared a glance for the linen room door, but there still was no sign of anyone there. Hopefully there wouldn't be, tonight. It looked like for whatever reason, Pol was keeping him company tonight.

It was still noisy in the adjacent room, but it was somewhat less deafening. Jerin sat down and saw that Pol had his deck of Commoner's Folly cards. Pol was a quick study of new games, and this was one that apparently was getting a fair bit of play outside the temple. Pol's elder brother had visited a few weeks ago, and dropped the deck off for Pol. A few games, and Pol was already a master. He had fast hands as well: he shuffled the cards with speed and slickness. Jerin would have accused him of cheating if it weren't for the fact that Pol didn't need to.

"What shall we play for?" he asked over the noise. Jerin was surprised. They weren't allowed to gamble. He dealt the cards, six for each and three face up cards in the middle of the table. The bartender, the miller and the blue six were showing. Jerin sat down at the table, and picked up his cards. A quick scan showed that the face up cards didn't help the cards in Jerin's hand much. He discarded, and covered the miller with his beggar. Pol drew and discarded as well, placing a seven on the six. They kept alternating turns until Pol put down his hand.

"Folly," he said. Jerin tossed his cards on the table in disgust. He'd been so close to making a Commoner Council. "So pay up," said Poll gathering the cards.

"We didn't agree to play for anything," objected Jerin.

"Oh, that's right," said Pol. "Then I'll agree now, ok?"

"What? No way." I don't have anything anyways."

"How about something you have plenty of? Something you'd be happier giving away?"

"Like what?" said Jerin, leaning back and crossing his arms.

"How about secrets?" Again, Jerin couldn't help but freeze for a moment. "C'mon, Jer," coaxed his small friend. "It's me. What have you got to lose?"

"I don't know what you're talking about," temporized Jerin.

"Oh, so you're going to tell me that you've been smiling so much for that past months because you've found that your true calling is doing laundry?"

Out of the corner of his eye, Jerin saw movement in the laundry room. He tried not to look, but he knew his eyes had betrayed him. There was Nessa, creeping cautiously into the laundry room, unmistakable in her common dress and long hair pulled up into twin pony tails tonight.

"Are you also going to tell me that if I turn around right now and look, I won't see whoever it is that you have been playing with?" Pol had a smug grin on his face now. "Someone who comes into the temple via that laundry chute into the alleyway?"

Jerin tried and failed to keep a smile off his face. He knew he was caught. Pol had maneuvered him deftly. Pol had always thrived on information. Being smaller than everyone else, he always used information to get what he needed. There wasn't an acolyte from the First Order down to the Fifteenth who didn't know that Pol was the person to go see when something was going on.

"Fine," said Jerin. "You've earned it." He looked at Nessa, who had ducked into a shadow when she realized that Jerin wasn't alone. He beckoned to her. Pol turned to look. When Nessa stepped out of the shadows, Pol nearly fell off his chair.

Nessa approached, and Pol's mouth dropped open. "Nessa, this is Pol, who I told you all about." Nessa looked Pol over appraisingly.

"He's not that short," she said. Pol snapped out of it.

"You told her I was short? She's a girl." He turned back to her. "You're a girl." She smirked.

"You acolytes have an amazing grasp of the facts." She turned to face Jerin. "Look, Jerin, I can't stay. But here's the last book." She pulled a small, leather-bound rectangle from a satchel she had slung over her shoulder. "Thanks."

"I've got a new one for you," said Jerin, reaching to a pocket inside his robe and pulling out a soft-bound book. "It's a more advanced reader," he explained. "Pol and I don't study this one for another year. It's all I could get my hands on today. Hope that's okay." She snatched it out of his hand. He took it that it was fine.

"You give her books?" asked Pol.

"I bring 'em back."

"But you're a girl. Girls don't read." Nessa's face darkened. Jerin felt a twinge of guilt, remembering that he himself had said pretty much the same thing to her only a few months previously. She spared a glance and a nod to Jerin, but then she turned and retraced her steps out of the room and across the laundry and through to the linen room.

She was gone. Pol was still evidently in shock. He stared in the direction that she had gone. "Girls don't read," he said simply.

"This one does."

"You taught her?" Jerin shrugged. He hadn't really done much.

"It I didn't think they could." Pol finally blinked. He looked at his friend. "It says so in our readers, Jer." Jerin knew what Pol meant. Girls on and women rarely if ever showed up in the books that the acolytes read. When they did, they were stupid and unable to learn anything. Not like Nessa at all.

"She's quick," Jerin said. "You'll like her."

"Oh, no," said Pols, standing. "I'm not going anywhere near her. If I'm lucky, I'll never see her again."

"What do you mean?"

"I mean I don't care who she is or if she is the smartest girl in all of Arnath. Do you have any idea what the priests would do to you..." he stopped and backtracked, "What they will do to you when they find out. And don't say they won't," he said, overriding the protest Jerin had been about to make. "The priests will find out. They always do. You know that." The sickly feeling of sin was back in his chest. Jerin knew he agreed with Pol.

Pol put a hand on Jerin's shoulder. "Look, you have been pretty careful. I didn't even notice things had changed, and then had to try really hard to figure out what you've been up to. I don't think any others have noticed, but accidents happen. Sometime, the wrong word will go in the wrong ear. It will. End this, before you end up out of the temple." He dropped the hand from Jerin's shoulder and picked his deck of cards up from the table. "She's not worth it."

"She is too," said Jerin. He knew Pol was right, but he hated to admit it. It had been so much fun. It was exciting to smuggle books out to Nessa. It was amazing to find all of the unused areas in the temple and figure out what they were for.

Pol left. Jerin waited for the washer to be finished, then wrung out the clothes in silence, all the time wondering what he should do. Maybe Pol wasn't right. But he usually was.

Jerin did continue to see Nessa, but it was with a growing sensation in the pit of his stomach that time was running out. He tried to be even more careful, ensuring no one marked his coming and goings. Being an outsider, that was not entirely difficult. Of course, Pol noted Jerin's absences, and more than once, had given Jerin a look that left no question that he knew what his friend was doing and didn't approve. It was straining their friendship, but he had no fear that Pol wold report him. He knew that he couldn't rely on any help if things went badly. That was okay. Jerin could live with that.

Unfortunately, the same physical attributes that made Jerin an outsider made him a target. And as a target for the other boys, Jerin didn't have to make a mistake to be caught.

Later, Pol would tell Jerin what had happened. It had been a free day. Pol knew that Jerin was away, somewhere in the temple, spending time with Nessa. He had seen Jerin pocket a book from the library, watch to see if anyone was watching, then slip out of the dorm. It was only a half hour later by the chimes of the temple bell that Q'docet entered the dorm. It was a surprise inspection. The boys had only moments to tidy up and stand beside their bunks with their footlockers open. Pol stood at his, and watched the priest slowly advance along the line of boys. He found minor infractions, and prescribed penances to several of the acolytes.

Jerin's bunk was fairly neat, and Pol had opened the footlocker for him. He didn't expect that Jerin would have anything incriminating in there. But the fact was that Jerin wasn't there. Just because it was a free day didn't mean that the boys could roam without permission. There were five boys who had approved leave today to visit with their families. Those absences would be forgiven, but no others.

Q'docet reached Pol. Pol drew himself up to his fullest height and stood at attention. His bunk and locker got the briefest of looks before the priest spoke.

"Where is the boy who shares this bunk?" he asked in a tone that held no emotion. Perhaps he had expected Pol to inform him that Jerin was on leave. But Pol was a realist, and knew that such a lie would only gain a few minutes and leave himself much the worse for it.

"I don't know, magister." That got the priest's attention.

"That's Jerin's bunk," said Hume, across the aisle from Pol.

"Perhaps he is running an errand," said Pol. That was as far as he was willing to stretch the truth.

"Nah, he's always slipping off, the straw-head," said Hume, with a sneer.

"Is he?" asked Q'docet, turning to Hume with interest on his face.

"Sure, he's only here half the time he's supposed to, maybe less."

"That's not true!" shot Pol. The look he got from the priest made him wish he had kept his silence. There was a look of suspicion there: suspicion that Pol was part of Jerin's delinquency. Hume wasn't done.

"He's always shirking his chores, too. Never see him on the work gangs any more." Pol screamed inside to say something to contradict the mean-sprited Hume. Jerin wasn't on the gangs, but it was because he had shifted to laundry duty. Maybe Hume knew that and maybe he didn't, but Pol wasn't going to speak up at this point. Jerin could defend his own work record, he didn't need Pol to do it.

"Do you have any idea where our young absentee might be?" the priest asked Pol. Pol had no idea. It was for this very reason that he had refused to get involved. He had no desire to hold a secret like that. He shook his head no. He was able to meet the priest's eyes.

"Does anyone here know the whereabouts of Jerin N'patri?" Q'docet asked in a voice loud enough to carry to both ends of the dorm. No one did. The inspection was cancelled. Instead, the acolytes were formed into teams and set to look for Jerin. The team that found him would be recognized for special service to the temple at the next rest day ceremony.

Pol looked at Hume's face, and it was bright with malice. He was whispering to his bunkmate, planning how to find him, no doubt. Pol had to go along, but he trailed behind his teammates, and didn't offer any suggestions.

In the end it was not his team that found Jerin and Nessa, and for that he was grateful. But they were found, and Q'docet was called for. Pol was intensely sorry for what happened to his friend, but he couldn't help but feel like he could have avoided it.

It was some time before Jerin could bring himself to speak to Pol, but in the end he had to. If he had been outcast before, this incident and only made it worse. No one would speak with him. He had made friends with a girl. The stories grew in the telling, and soon the legend was that he had been found kissing the girl, and she had had her dress off. The truth of the matter was lost and never found again.

## Rebellion: Age Thirteen

Jerin put down his quill. It was more difficult for him to re-ink it, since he had to reach across the writing desk with his left hand. He had to lift the cuff of his left sleeve clear of the page, for fear of smudging the ink that was still wet there. Idly, he rubbed at the twisted palm of his right hand as he re-read the passage that he had just written. It had taken years to learn to write legibly with his left instead of his right, and with it was still difficult to do so without smearing the ink. The Eldest at the front of the room looked up and spotted Jerin not writing. Hastily, Jerin picked up his quill again.

He and his classmates were doing their scribing class. Each boy had been assigned a book to copy, and every day they were at it, creating new copies of books from the library. Jerin had been assigned a history text. It told the stories of the rise of Arnath. The original was a copy of a copy of a copy of the original text, which had been written when the temple had been new.

The first king of Arnath, the man-god Melior, had carved his nation out of the warring cities of the plains south of the Barrier Range, uniting them under one banner. The sworn oath of the king was to fight off the evils that were trying to corrupt the area with unholy practices. Melior forged his rule from strength and laid down the codes of conduct and the Words. There were stories of how he stood at the head of the armies of the new nation and single-handedly threw down his enemies. The ground shook and swallowed entire nations. The winds and the rains obeyed his commands, and even the spirits of the dead rose to fight for Melior.

Jerin was on the last chapter of scribing now. It spoke of the years of peace which followed Melior's victories, and Melior's ascension.

And then he spake unto the masses: weep not at my departure, for I will never be far. I will come unto you again, and though those times will be dark, I will ever hold the light of justice in my right hand and the sword of vengeance in my left. He who believes in his heart that I am the body and soul of our land need never fear. Spread the word of my command, and you will join me in life everlasting. And he left signs that he was to return. To his disciples he left the bowl and sphere; the cup of life and the circle of eternity in one unalterable symbol.

Jerin looked down to the front of the robe he was wearing. There, stitched green on the white fabric was the bowl, with the sphere rising above it. But that was only the symbol of it. The actual relic was supposedly stored just beyond the hallows in the heart of the temple . One of the final ceremonies when an acolyte was raised to the priesthood was to be taken into the enclosure beyond the hallows, where the youth was blooded into the bowl. Legend had it that that the blood was absorbed by the basin, and made a part of it.

Jerin supposed he would see for himself one day, if he was lucky. He studied hard, and he followed the rules. He had no desire to ever see the inside of Q'docet's study again. It had been three and a half years since the last time, which probably was a record for the temple. Jerin hadn't far to look for a reminder of the last time. Any time he had an urge to misbehave, he looked down at his ruined right hand. For years he had woken regularly in the night, screaming he didn't mean to, please don't, don't... And yet, in his mind's eye, the cane still rose and fell wickedly on his outstretched palm. Jerin put down his quill and rubbed his palm again. It hadn't stopped at one stroke: by the fifth, it was unlikely that any of the bones of his hand were whole. None of them had healed properly, and now his hand was a crippled, useless appendage, unable to even hold anything.

And yet it didn't excuse Jerin from the chores that were the part of the acolyte life. He did his best to complete them, but it took twice as long as it did for those with two whole hands. No other was allowed to help, although no one but Pol would volunteer. It was a permanent reminder of the crime. Jerin did not know if there ever would be a day when he would truly be forgiven. It might be when he was raised to priesthood, if that day ever came.

Jerin continued his writing. The description of the bowl and sphere was probably one of the most detailed that he had ever read. It hinted at it having other strange properties. There was mention of the fact that the basin could never be filled. It was also described as having been held at the head of armies and ensured victory. It made Jerin insanely curious, if he was honest with himself, but each time he wrote another passage and felt an urge to see the relic for himself, he put down the quill and rubbed his ruined palm.

The bell temple bell rang, and everyone wiped the nibs of their quills and re-lidded their ink pots. Pages were blotted, and the books and their copies were shelved for the evening. The Eldest supervised them as they filed out of the room and headed for the mess hall. It was the end of the day, and it couldn't have come early enough. It had been a cruel day for Jerin, with the warrior training in the morning, and the chores in the early afternoon. He had been set to sweeping the great hall and entrance hall, and maneuvering the broom with a hand that could not grasp meant that he had missed the afternoon break and barely made it to the scribing lesson.

For three years, he had prayed to Melior to find the strength to emerge victorious from these trials. There was no excuse for what he had done. He had been set with hardships and they would make him strong enough to deserve a place in the Order. Today, he had again made it through the day.

The Twelfth Order left the study room in a disorderly pack. As they filed out the door, no one left any space for Jerin to leave the room. He didn't push in, just waited for the rest to leave. He watched the hems of the acolyte robes pass, the lighter summer fabric swishing around the sandals on each foot. There was a push on Jerin's elbow. He looked up to see Pol urging him to move. It was only them in the room now. Even the Eldest had left.

Pol walked with Jerin along the hall. More corridors fed together, and soon there was a jostling mob of youths heading for the mess hall. There was a small bubble of space around Jerin that never seemed to collapse. While Pol had to fight for space with his diminutive frame, Jerin could float along with the crowd. A group of Seventh Order boys merged into the crowd. They were seventeen; most would be raised to the priesthood within the year. They towered over Pol. They were laughing at some joke that had been told, and the nearest to Jerin turned to share it. Jerin recognized him as Kes. He was one of the Seventh Order boys who had never really tormented him, but he like everyone else had avoided Jerin since the incident.

Kes' laughter died as he realized that the boy next to him was the blond one with the broken hand. There was an uncomfortable moment where Kes' eyes met Jerin's before turning away and back to his friends.

Jerin was thankful that most of the acolytes chose to reject him. It was better than the alternative.

He wasn't paying attention to his feet as he entered the mess hall, and was caught completely by surprise when he found himself falling forwards. He flung out his hands to catch himself, but still slammed into the flag tiles of the hall. The air rushed from him, and a sharp jolt of pain shocked his right hand and arm at they hit the floor. Jerin desperately sucked in air. He became aware of a chorus of laughter, and noted that he had fallen suspiciously close to a table where Hume, Ayb and the rest of the Twelfth Order were sitting. They had obviously rushed ahead in the crowd, and were already waiting for the signal to eat.

They were laughing and watching Jerin as he tried to rise. They had tripped him. Hands helped Jerin up to his knees and then to his feet. It was Pol, and Kes was on the other side. As soon as Jerin was upright, Kes let go of his arm and moved away quickly.

"Have to watch those stones, they can be tricky," said Hume. Jerin felt Pol's arms hands tighten on his arm, as though preparing to hold his friend back from fighting. The air was returning to his lungs. Jerin did feel a surge of anger. He looked to the head table, where all of the teaching priests were seated. Several were looking his way, but none were looking like they would intervene. Acolytes were not barred from fighting each other. But as all acolytes learned, any fight that started would not be broken up. Whether an acolyte was training to be a warrior or not, each was expected to finish whatever they started.

Jerin did not consider himself a coward. He was a realist. Hume was sitting among friends who were as large as Jerin or larger. Ayb, who had always been the biggest of their Order, was already apprenticed into the warrior ranks. Jakab, still with his birthmark across his eye, had proven himself a vicious fighter. Jerin had only the smallest of the acolytes to back him up.

Whether it was accepting the punishment that had left him disfigured, or the curse that made him look like he did, he had to accept these things. He couldn't even make a fist with his right hands.

"What's the matter, straw head? Look like you're swallowing a sour plum." Jerin turned away. Pol released his hold on Jerin's arm and got in line with him to retrieve his food. Accepting the humiliation had never gotten any easier. He had sinned and been punished, but his sin clung to him. He did his best not to look at anyone as he left Hume and the others behind, but he couldn't help but see the distain on so many faces. Disapproval washed over him. The Words of Melior directed each man to "seek that which he was entitled, fight for what was denied, and seek vengeance on those who wronged him". The words were inscribed above the doors into the hallows of the temple. Jerin asked himself if he deserved to have a place in the temple if he did not live according to the Words? Jerin held out the rough earthenware plate for the cook to fill. Unwittingly, Jerin looked up and saw a flicker of contempt at the corner of the cook's mouth. Even the help was shocked that an acolyte of the temple would permit such an embarrassment to go unanswered.

Once Jerin was seated at a table with Pol next to him, he sat and waited for the prayer to be said from the head table. He did his best to not look at any of the others who were at the table with him. There was some uncomfortable shifting as the boy to his left moved to open a handspan of space between himself and Jerin.

Above the head table was a huge stained glass window, which showed Melior in a red robe, with a hand upraised, with lines of golden light radiating out. To his left stood Levifid, the archangel. To his right was Sicaria, Melior' avenging angel. Her dress was white and her hair as black as night, and her sword was raised with blood along the edge. Both flanking angels were shown smaller than him. Melior was shown as he was in so many of the texts they had studied: tall, with dark, short hair and clean shaven, but with a glow coming from his eyes.

Jerin had looked at the glass thousands of times before, but it seemed that this time he could feel in his heart that he had failed the spirit of what they stood for. Where was the strength that he could display to others? How could a priest inspire the people without the fire inside to fight for what was right? Let people know that their bodies and souls were in strong hands? He didn't have the nerve to stand up for anything. He might go through the motions and learn the words of the prayers, but he realized that there was no way that he would ever have that edge that the priesthood required.

It was strange. Jerin was intensely aware of everything, from the smell of the beef and cabbage rising from his plate, to the low noise of the acolytes' voices, to the very colour of the light that played in the room as the sun shone through the stained glass. The pain in his arm and in his knees where they had banged the floor mixed into the sensation.

This was the moment. It was the moment when he could feel his faith die. It wasn't his faith in Melior: he had no more faith in himself. He was an acolyte in a church that would never accept him. He didn't even know why he was here. He just always had been. He was a pariah, not welcome here, and barely tolerated. He stroked his now-throbbing right hand, as the prayer rose and the rest of the room fell silent. He paid no attention to the words. Robur per fidem, he intoned with the others when the prayer ended and everyone started eating. Jerin did not. He stared at the head table, where Q'docet sat and ate while he listened to what another priest was saying to him on his right.

Jerin was fixated on him. He was what would be considered middle-aged. his brown hair was growing grey at the temples, and his short beard was speckled with grey, particularly where the frown lines descended from the mouth. Though he was calmly chewing and offering a few words in conversation at the moment, Jerin could not help but picture him pulling back his lips and baring his teeth, his eyes wide in anger as the cane rose and fell. Some small part of Jerin reared up inside and did not flinch as usual when he remembered that day. There was a spark of anger at what had happened to him.

That was unusual. Normally these memories brought feelings of shame and fear. But tonight, in the midst of hundreds of acolytes and in the warm light of the images of Melior and his cohort, Jerin felt anger towards his priest, his teacher, his mentor. Jerin had never had a father, and to some extent, Q'docet was as much of a father as he'd ever had. A door in Jerin's mind that had stayed closed for years opened a crack.

Jerin didn't flee inside his skull from the fierce image of Q'docet. There was another face that came into his mind, one that he hadn't allowed himself to remember in years. For the first time in what seemed like forever, Jerin remembered how happy he had been in those few months that he had roamed the hidden ways of the temple. He remembered exploring both the geography of the his home, and also roaming far and wide through the written works that he had shared with Nessa. He remembered her screams as she had been strapped. Her dress was lifted over her head, exposing her bare back. The thin leather had cut into her several times before her dress had been lowered and she had been turned out of the temple. Her screams hadn't haunted him until now. He had never let them in. He had closed them off, content to linger in a half-life where his spirit had fled from him.

"Jerin," Pol hissed. "What's wrong?" Jerin realized that he was crying. Tears were blurring his vision and running down his cheeks. He didn't wipe them away. Somehow, he saw them as symbolic. He was awash in pain and anger that he had denied for so long. He had woken up and really felt again for the first time in a long time. It was glorious.

He wanted to stand up and shout at the collected priests and acolytes. If they wanted to break him, they would need to try harder than this. He might not be wanted, but if they wouldn't turn him out of the temple, then he would stay on his own terms. The tears were just the open declaration that Jerin was going to live. Unbidden, the thought occurred to him that he wondered where Nessa was. He hoped a that she was okay.

Jerin was struck by an idea. It was an audacious idea. There was suddenly nothing more important in the whole world. He was going to do something that he had never had the courage to do before. Jerin rose, long before any of the rest of the boys in the hall were finished eating. He left his food on the table and walked with a straight back along the rows of tables and out of the mess hall. He left the tears on his face. Let them all think that the pariah had finally cracked. Perhaps I have, he thought. When he was in the relative quiet of the corridor, Jerin was surprised to hear footsteps behind him. He spared a glance, and saw the one person in the temple who had never treated him differently for his looks.

It was Pol, of course. He was walking with his shorter steps to keep up. He didn't ask where they were going. He only followed his friend down the empty corridor, away from his meal. When Jerin stopped at a tapestry and pulled it aside to show a hidden staircase heading down, his friend only followed him into the dark. The tapestry showed the King of Rhed kneeling at the foot of Melior, and as it fell back into place, they were temporarily blind in the dark. Jerin had forgotten how dark some of these hidden passages were. There was no light to see by at all. It was only by the touch of the stone at his fingertips and the steps under his feet that he navigated.

The stairs spiralled, and after an unknown number of turns, ended at a heavy wooden door. It swung open and the dim light of the corridor beyond made their eyes blink. There was only a single brass lamp hanging from a rough wall mount, but it seemed glaringly bright. They were near to their destination. This was a narrow side corridor, and it led to a much larger one with a massive arched doorway at the end.

*Queram te, que inscribitur. Negatur quod pro. Qui peccavit tibi vindicas.* There were the Words of Melior, carved into the marble forming the arch. Jerin felt a surge inside him. Perhaps he did not live by the Words, but he was going to live. Pol finally broke his silence.

"Uh, Jer, why are we at the Hallows?" As Jerin pushed open the door, he corrected himself: "Umm... going into the hallows?" Jerin didn't want to say it out loud. He felt that if he put the idea into words, his nerve would leave him. He led onwards. Past the rows of benches, past the rows of statues looking down. They moved towards the dais at the front of the Hallows. The dais stood before the closed door that sealed the Hallows away from the chamber beyond.

Where the relic lay.

Jerin didn't know why it had occurred to him, but in all of the exploring that he had done with Nessa, they had never dared the Hallows and the inner chamber beyond. Perhaps it was just too audacious. The relic was only to be seen in the ceremony to raise a boy to the priesthood. Maybe Jerin might never become a priest, and so would never get to see it. Whatever the reason, tonight was the night to break through the door and see what lay on the other side. Maybe there would be answers.

Jerin strode up to the door to the inner chamber. It was decorated with the symbol of the bowl and the sphere, the figures carved into the dark wood of the door. There was a latch, but no visible lock. Pol caught up just as Jerin was scanning the door.

"What fever has taken your brain?" panted Pol, anxiety on his face. "I followed you because I thought you needed a friend, not because I thought you were going to commit a blasphemy."

"Who says it's a blasphemy?" asked Jerin. He gave the door an experimental push. It swung open easily.

"You shouldn't be doing this," said Pol. his voice was hoarse. Jerin only felt a thrill of discovery. It was something he hadn't felt in a long time. There was a dim light inside. The door to the room was low, so that he had to duck slightly. A grown man would have to stoop to enter.

It was dim inside, and his eyes took a moment to adjust. What met Jerin's eyes was stranger than he had ever expected. The room inside was nothing like the blocky lines and smooth arches of the Hallows. The room looked like it had been carved or melted out of black glass. It was small enough that Jerin could have thrown a stone across it; it was more of a cave than a room. The light inside was an orange-red glow that seemed to pulse. The light seemed to have a radiant source, but there was no lamp that Jerin could see. Jerin took in a sharp breath. There was a tang of metal in the air, almost like the taste of blood in your mouth. The floor was uneven, a continuation of the walls that flowed down to it. There really was no line where the walls and floor met, it was all a formless blur. Despite the light in the room, the ceiling looked lost in shadows. In the centre of the room, the floor rose up in rivers of frozen glass to a central plinth. The light was radiating from the top of the plinth. That was where Jerin saw the relic.

Jerin took a step into the room.

"Melior protegendum nos," breathed Pol behind him. Jerin jumped at the sound. He had forgotten his friend was there. Pol's face was white, and his eyes were wide and staring at the relic. But Pol did not turn away. He moved forward with a tentative step and slipped his hand into Jerin's. Jerin gave the hand a squeeze, then turned back to view the relic again. For a moment, they both stood there in awe.

It seemed to emit the light in the room, but it did not glow. It seemed to Jerin that the light flowed from it, radiating out in all directions. He and Pol had shadows that played on the irregular walls behind them. The relic was not large, but the bowl was about the size of the baskets that the grocers used when they brought fruits and vegetables into the temple. The bowl was shallow, much like the shape of the large one in the square outside the temple. And above it, suspended by nothing that Jerin could see, was a sphere of what appeared to be steel.

This relic was the symbol of Melior in Arnath. It was the token that he left to show that he would someday return. Apart, the basin and the sphere would be unremarkable, but the sphere sat there, hovering above the bowl as though locked into a foundation of adamant.

"Come on, let's go," say Pol in a frantic whisper. Jerin shook himself. He didn't know how long they had been standing inside the doorway, but it felt like ages. The relic seemed to draw his eyes. Jerin had trouble looking away from it.

"I'm going to touch it," said Jerin.

"Are you insane?" Pol said. Pol tugged on Jerin's hand, but Jerin yanked it away. "We need to get out of here before there are consequences."

"Pol maybe you will get to touch it someday, when you are raised, but I don't think I'll ever get to. This is my chance."

"What are you saying?"

Jerin sat started walking towards the centre of the room. The floor was tricky to walk on. "I mean I don't think I have what it takes to be a priest. It might be tomorrow, or it might be five years from now, but eventually Q'docet is going to realize that too." There was a way up, Jerin could see it. Of course, there had to be. After all, how would the acolytes reach the bowl during their raising if there wasn't? Jerin wouldn't call it a staircase, but it had enough of a resemblance to make climbing straightforward. It wound around the plinth haphazardly.

"Are you saying you're leaving?" Pol asked, in a loud whisper that covered the distance in the silent room. That stopped Jerin short.

Is that what I am saying?

"Where would you go?" said Pol.

"No," Jerin said, resuming his climb. He was up higher now, and when he looked back at Pol he looked down at his upturned face. "I don't know." There wasn't anything more to say. Jerin had reached the level of the top of the glassy column, and before him was the relic.

Even though the climb had not been difficult, Jerin found himself breathing heavily. He was close enough to touch it. Raising his hand, with his palm outwards, he could feel the power radiating from it. It was like a warm glow, but there also was a feeling of resistance, like moving his hand any closer was going to be hard work. Gingerly, he placed his hands on the rim of the basin. The surface looked like grey stone, but the surface felt smoother than anything he had ever felt. It also felt warm to the touch. The way the feeling pulsed made Jerin think of something that was alive.

He had done it. He had touched the relic. No matter what happened afterwards, he would know that he had come as close to touching God as he would ever get. Looking into the bowl, there was no dark stain like that in the execution basin in the square. If the acolytes were blooded before they were raised, there was no evidence in the bowl. And then there was the sphere. This close, Jerin could see that it had imperfections in the surface. It looked very much like the iron shot they sometimes used in the great siege engines of the army. It certainly was not perfect. Jerin wondered at that. He would have expected the symbol of a man-god to be more… idealized. Polished. Fancy.

But the relic did not need to be perfect. For there it sat, radiating power, with the sphere that hung exactly above the centre of the bowl. The image of it echoed in so many places through out the temple and the city. He had never seen it, but Jerin had read that the image of the relic was inscribed across all of Arnath.

The sphere did not move. It did not rotate or sway, and there was nothing visible suspending it. Jerin rubbed his face with his whole hand, and was surprised that his hand came back wet with sweat. Experimentally, he waved a hand above the iron sphere.  He had to reach up.

Nothing impeded his hand. No strings or wires that were too fine to see in the dim light held the sphere up. When he looked away and used the edge of his vision, Jerin thought he could see something underneath the sphere. Was there something there, supporting it from below? He looked closely, but saw nothing now. He put his hand between the sphere and the bowl, and everything went black.

Jerin ached all over. It seemed there wasn't a part of him that didn't feel like it had been hit with hammers. His head was the worst. He tried to sit up, and immediately felt a wave of nausea. He hadn't time to open his eyes, before he rolled to the side and retched. His hands supported him, and the floor felt strange. It was uneven and smooth to the touch. His eyes snapped fully aware as he realized that they were still in the chamber with the relic.

"Jerin! Are you okay?" It was Pol. He was still there. Jerin looked upwards, and could see the glassy plinth rising up above him. Had he fallen from all the way up there?

"What happened?" Jerin asked. He grabbed at his skull. Speaking caused an indescribable pain.

"You collapsed," Pol said as he knelt next to Jerin. He produced a rag and pressed it to Jerin's scalp. When he jerked away, Poi grabbed his shoulder to hold him still. "You're bleeding. You hit your head when you tumbled." Jerin held still. He quickly checked his arms and legs for any more damage.

Yes, he felt like he'd just fallen down from the top of the plinth. He was dizzy. He must have hit his head pretty hard. "What happened?" he repeated. "The last thing I remember is putting my hand under—"

"You just collapsed," said Pol. "You went limp like someone had snuffed a candle. And then you fell." He lifted the rag from Jerin's head and looked at it. "I think it's stopping. It's not that bad."

"Says you," muttered Jerin. It might not be bleeding, but his head was hurting terribly. There was a deep throbbing behind his eyes.

"Can you stand?"

"I don't know."

"We still might be caught here. Come on," he said, as he extended a hand to Jerin. Together, they got him upright. Jerin swayed, but stayed on his feet. Another wave of nausea rose, but this time Jerin mastered his stomach.

Pol led, with Jerin leaning on him as they exited the relic room. There was no one in the Hallows, and they hurried as best they could. Now that they were leaving, and for better or worse he had done what he came to do, Jerin no longer felt the strange fatalism that had taken him earlier. He had no more wish to be caught than Pol did.

They found the spiral staircase and climbed it in the dark. The exertion made Jerin's head pound all the more, and he very nearly toppled as dizziness took him again. Pol held him against the invisible wall of the staircase until it passed, then they continued climbing. They slipped out from behind the tapestry, and were moving along the passage when a voice stopped them.

"Acolytes, where are you going?" Pol froze, and Jerin stumbled to a halt. They turned, to see another of the teaching priests striding towards them. His black robe was lined with emerald, and his face was clean shaven and more youthful than Q'docet's. It was Q'sammal, who was responsible for the order two years younger than Pol and Jerin. There was a look of grim recognition on his face. Of course he recognized Jerin: he stood out from the rest of the acolyte population like a brick in a coal pile. "The cripple," he said with contempt. "Where did you run away to during— what is wrong with you?" he asked when he got a look at Jerin. The cut on his scalp had broken open and Jerin could feel blood trickling through his hair near his ear. Pol, the quick-witted one, answered.

"Saluto, Magister. Acolyte Jerin fell and struck his head." Pol lowered his eyes as he spoke, and signed the bowl and fist to his forehead. The priest looked to Pol and waited for him to continue. "I followed him from the mess hall, and he got ahead of me. I heard him fall and found him at the bottom of the sixth stair. I was taking him back to the dorm to lie down."

"I should think he needs more than a lie down," said the priest. He plucked gingerly at Jerin's hair where it was matted. "Follow me," he said as he turned and led in the direction of the temple's healing wing.

"Thanks, Pol," Jerin whispered as they lurched back into motion. Jerin was still relying on Pol to keep him upright.

"No worries."

Jerin was confined to the healing wing for fifteen days. When they arrived at the healing wing, Q'sammal explained to the Medicus how he had found them. He repeated what Pol had said, describing the fall. There was something in the way he said it that implied that Jerin was not worth the time to heal, but the Medicus paid no mind. He carefully led Jerin to a soft bunk and began a gentle but thorough inspection. He clucked his teeth as he looked at the head wound.

Then he got Jerin to look at his eyes and then follow a finger as he moved it back and forth in front of his face. The Medicus was older, with more grey hair than brown, and lots of lines on his face, but he was strong as he used his hands to search for broken bones or injuries to Jerin's viscera. Jerin winced as he was asked to take a deep breath.

"Definitely had a good fall," the healer said finally. "The head's the worst, but there's a cracked rib here too." He got up from the edge of the bed and turned to face Q'sammal. "Bed rest. A week at least, maybe more."
Q'sammal looked as though he wanted to refute the diagnosis and claim that Jerin was faking it, but it wasn't his place as a new priest of his rank to question the Medicus. He snapped at Pol instead.

"You will return to the dorm. I will inform your teacher of what has happened tonight."

Jerin was in and out of consciousness for the next 24 hours. Part of it was the effect of the head blow, and the rest was the mixture of herbs that the attendants kept infusing his food and drink with. When he was awake, Jerin worried about what Q'docet would do to Pol. He imagined a vindictive Q'sammal teaming up with the sadistic Q'docet and feared for his friend's skin.

Pol did return to visit Jerin in the healing wing a couple days later. "Nah, I didn't get in trouble," he answered Jerin. "though Q'docet did his best to try to get me to confess to something." Poi grinned. "But even he couldn't punish a boy who had only gone to his friend's aid." Jerin smiled as he pictured Pol assuming his blankest face and answering Q'docet's questions.

But his face fell again. "Yeah, but I won't be so lucky," said Jerin. Jerin expected the priest to appear in the healing wing at some point. He would have no excuse: he had left the mess hall and been careless. Whatever conclusion the priest drew, it wasn't going to be anywhere near the truth, but it would be bad enough.

"Don't let it get you down," said Pol, look making eye contact and holding it. "It'll pass." Jerin knew it would, but the palm of his broken hand itched furiously when Jerin imagined what might happen.

Pol couldn't stop by every day. His responsibilities kept him busy and there was a strict curfew. None of the Eldests or priests had any sympathy for Jerin. Pol had to make time when there were absolutely no chores to be done or lessons to be learned.

On the afternoon of the third day since that first visit, Jerin looked up from the book he was reading. The sun was coming through the windows of the healing hall. The book was a history of modern Arnath. Jerin had picked it out from the Library two weeks ago, and Pol had dropped it off for Jerin when he had visited the previous day. Jerin could only read for short periods before headaches returned, but it was worth it to his mind. Nothing ever happened in the healing wing. None of the priests who worked in the wing wanted anything to do with him and avoided him as much as they could without overtly neglecting him.

There was another person three beds down on the opposite side of the hall. It was an acolyte, Rend, who had contracted a cough. He had been taken out of the dorms immediately and brought here. Hopefully it wouldn't spread. The cough was annoying Jerin. It was dry and incessant and rang off the walls of the healer hall. The boy with the cough was no more than eight. He didn't move around much and was pale. Right now, Rend was dozing and so only coughed fitfully from time to time.

Still, Jerin had looked up from his book. He felt something, like a draft, but there wasn't a breath of air moving in the hall. It was a slight sensation, like his flesh crawling. He ran his hands up and down his arms, but that didn't stop it. It was distracting. He tried to read some more, but it was like a mosquito buzzing. Jerin frowned and looked in the direction of the sensation. He didn't know how he knew that was the right direction, but it was. It was moving, slowly.

He did his best to try to understand what it was that he was looking for. It wasn't like a presence in the room. In fact, it felt more like an absence. Jerin felt like he was being drawn in a certain direction. Like a hook was in his guts and was drawing him in towards something. He might have gotten out of bed, but the sensation was moving. It was coming from below and in the direction of the centre of the temple. It wasn't comfortable. It was such a visceral thing, the closest he could compare it to was the time when he had been hit in the testicles in a fight. It wasn't as painful as that, but the sensation invaded his core in the same way.

The direction of the pull was now rising. It stopped when it was level with Jerin. Now it was moving laterally. It was moving from right to left, as though... as though it was someone walking along the hallway outside the healing hall. The pull stopped exactly when it reached the door to the hall. Jerin watched as the door opened. Pol's head poked in and looked around. His face brightened when he saw Jerin sitting up and looking at him. He came all the way into the hall. He was holding something behind his back. Was whatever he was holding the source of the pull? Jerin watched as his friend approached.

"Hey Jer," he said. "I brought you something." With a flourish, he produced a baked tart.

"Oh," said Jerin. Whatever was causing the pull, it wasn't likely to be a tart. Perhaps sensing that Jerin was disappointed, Pol tried selling the tart.

"It's berry. We had them especially today at lunch. I thought they were your absolute favourite." Jerin was distracted. The sensation hadn't gone away.

"What?" Jerin said, when he realized what Pol had said about the tart. "No, it's not the tart. I just..." Jerin didn't know what to say. What was it about Pol that was causing this draw? Jerin reached out with his hand and groped in Pol's direction. His friend's eyes widened and he backed away a half step.

Jerin struck on an idea. "Pol, come over to this side of the bed," he said, beckoning to the right side, opposite where Pol was.

"S— sure," said Pol. He edged around the bed, all the while watching Jerin. The sensation followed him. When Pol reached the other side of the healing bunk, the visceral sensation of a pull was coming from that direction. "What gives?" asked Pol. "Are you feeling okay? Has the Medicus given you your herbs this afternoon?" Jerin was frowning, staring at the centre of Pol's chest. He reached out and put his hand on Pol's the front of Pol's acolyte robes. Pol moved away.

"No, it's all right," said Jerin. Pol moved back and Jerin put his hand there again. He was absolutely certain that this was were the sensation was radiating from. It was almost like the sensation that the relic had given. Except the relic had radiated a sense of pushing away, while Pol was drawing him closer.

"Did anything happen to you—" Jerin cut off and looked around. The Medicus was not in sight, but one of the junior healer apprentice priests was at the far end of the hall, preparing one of the revolting infusions they liked to administer. He lowered his voice and continued. "— in the… room." Their eyes met, and Jerin could see that Pol understood. "Anything?"

"Like what?" asked Pol in a whisper.

"I don't know."

"You don't know?" Pol said with exasperation. "It was you who blacked out and fell. I just watched." Jerin knew Pol was right. But what other explanation could there be?

"Here, let me show you something," said Jerin. "Pass me two of those cotton balls." He gestured at the table between the beds opposite. The beds were empty, but the table between them had a small supply of useful healing supplies. Pol got some, and Jerin quickly made a blindfold from a handkerchief. he stuffed the cotton in his ears, and wrapped the blindfold around his eyes.

"Now walk around the hall." Jerin laid back against his pillow.

"Where?" said Pol. His voice was muffled by the cotton, but Jerin could make it out.

"Just anywhere." He waved a hand, encompassing the whole hall. Jerin knew that Pol complied, because he felt the pull start to drift. He raised his left arm and pointed in the direction of the feeling. As the pull moved, Jerin kept pointing at it. It headed to the right first of all, then reversed. It moved quickly to the side, as though Pol had ducked between two beds, then it continued. Perhaps he had reached the door to the hall. Then the sensation came closer, until Jerin was pointing to the spot right next to his bed. He lifted the blindfold, and there Pol was. He pulled the blindfold off and dug the cotton out of his ears.

"How did you do that?" There was disbelief on Pol's face. "You cheated."

"I don't know how I did it," was Jerin's honest reply. Jerin explained what he knew in a whisper. "I only noticed it when you were coming here this afternoon, just a few minutes ago." He beckoned Pol closer. He placed a hand on Pol's sternum. "Right here. Right here is where it is. You're sure nothing happened to you?"

"No, Jer," said Pol. "I watched you touching the relic," he looked around quickly. Rend was still dozing in his bed, and the healer apprentice was still at the far end of the hall. "And then you just went limp. You fell without even trying to save yourself or break the fall."

They discussed it until the time came that Pol had to hurry to meet his work gang. They came to no conclusions. Pol could not feel anything. Jerin couldn't feel any pull from any other thing except Pol.

"Well, one thing's for certain," said Pol. "I'm not playing hide and seek with you anymore." He grinned, and Jerin took a swipe at him and missed.

Over the course of the next week and a half, the two boys tried to figure out what it was that Jerin was feeling. They ran experiments, where Pol would try to get far enough away or go deep enough in the temple to have Jerin lose the signal. He tried going deep into the temples' lowest levels, where there was natural rock between himself and Jerin in the healing hall. But nothing seemed to affect the sensation. All day, every day, at any time, Jerin could point to where Pol was. Jerin started keeping notes, trying to record where he thought Pol was during the day. There were long periods when Pol was in classes or eating or in prayer when he didn't move, and then there were times that he was in constant motion, like when doing chores. Pol brought Jerin a map of the temple, and he referred to it when noting Pol's location. It wasn't exact, because just having a bearing wasn't enough. The sensation never seemed to diminish, so Jerin couldn't tell how far away Pol was. He could look at the map and guess where Pol was along that direction, but sometimes he guessed wrong.

"It's weird," said Pol after dinner on the last night before Jerin was to be released from the healer hall. The wound on his scalp had knitted well without infection, and the bruises were all yellowing. Jerin was tired of the stinky poultices the healers put on the wound. They claimed a that they had fought off any disease, but Jerin doubted that anything that smelled that bad could have any positive effects whatsoever. Of course, the priests had led Jerin in a special prayer three times per day. The prayers had been in High Cleric, and Jerin had only understood parts of it.

"Do you suppose it's a spirit?" asked Jerin.

"Huh?" said Pol, startled.

"It's a relic. It could have channeled a spirit." Alarm coloured Pols face as he looked around to see that no one was near enough to hear. The closest person was the young boy with the cough. The cough had subsided, but it had been replaced with a terrible fever and then a listlessness that was alarming the healers. Right now, Jerin couldn't tell if the boy was asleep or just in one of his stupors. Jerin continued, thinking out loud. "Maybe... I don't know. It's a link. With the supernatural."

"So, who's possessed, you?" asked Pol. "Or is it me? I've possessed you and you can sense it?"

"Forget it," said Jerin. "Man, I am so tired of bed rest. I could kill for doing something, even chores."

"Careful what you ask for," warned Pol.

Pol was prescient. No sooner was Jerin released from the healing hall, than he was summoned to Q'docet's study. Jerin had barely returned to the dorm when Jakab had informed him of the summons. Immediately, the room had gone silent. All of the other boys in earshot had stopped what they were doing and turned to look at Jerin. Hume, who had been making notes in his prayer book on the bunk opposite, smirked as he watched Jerin. Jerin didn't feel like Q'docet had any reason to suspect what he and Pol had been doing when he got hurt, but any invitation to the study was deserving of caution, if not anxiety.

Feeling like every eye was on him, Jerin left the dorm and made his way to the row of offices that the teaching priests occupied. He waited until his knock was answered from within, then entered. The Q'docet seemed irritated. "Effective immediately, you are excused from your classes." He handed Jerin a script of paper. "Take this to the keeper of the grounds. He will be responsible for your schedule."

Whatever Jerin had been expecting, this wasn't it. The keeper of the grounds? Jerin had to think for a moment to even remember where he might find him. Jerin couldn't have seen him more than a few times in the last year. Caught up with his internal confusion, Jerin blurted out what was first in his mind.

"For how long?" Apparently it was the wrong thing to ask.

"For as long as it takes!" Q'docet snapped. "For as long as it takes for you to make up your mind whether or not you want to rise to become one of us, or leave." Jerin felt colour drain from his face. Was he being drummed out of the temple? He hadn't thought that the day would come.

"Don't think I've forgotten your display in the mess hall from two weeks ago." Jerin thought back. The mess hall. The trip by his Order mates. His refusal to fight Hume when the odds were stacked against him. The memories continued to haunt him, but in a way, the experience in the relic room had changed Jerin's outlook.

"We expect the youths who are studying here to be strong and uphold the name of Melior and to honour his Words."

"I know, Magister, but—"

"Was it because of being outnumbered?" he sneered. "When a priest of Melior goes out into the wild to spread the Words, he is always outnumbered. Was it because his friends were bigger and stronger than you? That is the normal way of life: there is always someone bigger and stronger than you are. Was it because of this?" The priest grabbed Jerin's wrist and held up Jerin's twisted right hand. "This does not excuse you from anything. You will be expected to be everything a follower of Melior should be, whole or not. The reminder of your past sins will follow you forever and will make you work harder. Forgiveness is for the weak." Q'docet sat back down in his chair behind the desk. "Now, leave my sight. Robur per fidem."

Jerin signed the bowl and fist to forehead, then turned and let himself out of the study. He didn't know if he had managed to conceal his anger from the priest, but it took all of his self control not to slam the door behind him.

He did report to the keeper of the grounds. It was some small comfort that he knew several different ways to get onto the roof of the temple. He had spent so much time with Nessa, exploring the out of the way parts of the building. Again, he felt cold inside when he thought of Nessa.

The keeper of the grounds was Tulan F'horus. He was a scrawny priest, with skin that was browned from decades of time spent in the sun, and a back that was permanently bent from tending to the things that grew in the ground. Jerin didn't know whether or not this man was typical for the post, but as a priest of the temple he was beyond strange. He seldom descended into the main body of the temple, preferring to remain up in the rooftop areas, in the open air. He even had quarters at the rooftop level, opening only to the open spaces. It was here that Jerin found the priest. He was up to his wrists in fresh earth, digging around in a clay pot.

Jerin presented the paper to him. "From Q'docet, Magister," he said.

The keeper of the grounds looked up from his dirt, studying the paper from under thick, bushy eyebrows that were startlingly white as was his hair. He snorted and then turned his dark eyes to Jerin, appraising him.

"From Q'docet, is it? He sent you?" He peered past Jerin. "And no others?" Jerin looked behind himself, as though expecting to see someone else.

"No, Magister," he said. "Only me." He held out the paper again. This time, the priest withdrew his hands from the pot and wiped them on the breasts of his robe. The robe was filthy with fresh earthen stains. Jerin could not believe that any priest of the order would treat his robe so. The priest took the paper, unfolded it, and read the contents. His eyes were hidden by his eyebrows, but Jerin sensed that the priest was taking his time reading the note.

"Most unusual directive, my son," he said. "You are to report to me each day?"

"Yes, Magister."

"And stuff that Magister up your ass. Jerin, is it? Tulan is my name." Then he put Jerin to work.

The Temple to Melior was the largest structure in all of Lagroth, and while it was a massive, sprawling stone fortress, it was softened by green things in many places. The haphazard design of the temple seemed to have left voids in the structure, which had been turned into small gardened alcoves. It took a keen mind to learn all of the routes through the temple which led to each of them.

However, the inner alcoves were easy compared to the outer gardens. At eight points around the outer faces of the temple were hanging gardens. The roof areas drained into them, keeping them well watered in the wet seasons, but during the dry summer months, it was almost a full time job for a single person to get to all of them during the course of a day.

"I usually have two or three of you boys help on a rotation," Tulan grumbled as he was showing Jerin his tasks, "not one who has a broken-down hand." The hand was a problem. For more than half of the hanging gardens, it required a good head for heights and a solid grip to lean out into nothing to pour water in and tend the plants. Between the effort of hauling water to all points of the temple and climbing to where the gardens lay, Jerin was exhausted within a few hours. When the midday meal bell rang, Jerin deposited his watering can at the grounds shed and stumbled to the mess hall.

He arrived late, trying vainly to brush the dirty spots from his robe. The knees, elbows and chest were all marked with dirt from climbing to the gardens. The priests were already at the head table, so the only consequence was a foul stare from the cook who filled Jerin's plate. There were only a few spaces left at the tables, so Jerin selected one between two acolytes who were a couple years younger than he was and placed his plate on the table as he sat down. Immediately, the two boys turned their backs. Jerin found himself the divide between two groups. He was exhausted and sore, and ate a very lonely lunch.

The afternoon was worse. The sun was hotter, and as he got more and more tired, he had to slow down to be safe. One of his first destinations after lunch was the massive cascading planters on either side of the main temple gates. They were a set of vertically stacked gardens that started at the top of the outer wall and were set one under the other to a point halfway down the wall.

Jerin had serviced the top three levels when he slipped. He had to climb down from the top to reach the lower levels. The best solution he'd found was to use his ruined right hand to hold the watering can and tools, and then climb with his good left one. But on this occasion, the can slipped from the half-grip and fell. Jerin's natural reaction had been to grab for it, but doing so, his grip on the edge of the planter had loosened, and for a moment, he had started falling. He had managed to grab hold of the stone rim of the garden before plunging all the way to the paving stones below.

Breathing hard, he looked down to see the watering can rolling in a pool of spilled water below. He clung to the stone lip of a planter and breathed in and out. When he had regained his composure, Jerin climbed back up the stone monument to the top of the wall. His entire body was shaking from the near-fall. He told the gardener what had happened.

"Go retrieve the watering can," said Tulan. He was pruning one of the dwarf trees that decorated a south-facing niche in the temple.

"Sir?" said Jerin. "It's outside the walls."

"You said you were at the gardens outside the front gate."

"Yes, Tulan."

"Then the can will be no more than a few paces outside. Be about it quickly."

Jerin complied. He ran through the mostly deserted halls of the temple, until he reached the front gates. The massive, iron-bound oaken doors were open during the day.  A priest always had the duty to wait inside them, should any petitioner approach the temple. But no acolytes ever went out, except for the executions.

The priest sat inside the doors, in a massive oak chair. The chair faced out towards the open space of the square beyond the doors. He turned to look at Jerin as he approached. He did not speak, but crooked an eyebrow at the interruption.

"Dropped a watering can," said Jerin, somewhat out of breath. He pointed out the doors.

"Ah, I heard something fall," said the priest. He looked at the state of Jerin's robe. "The least acolyte of the temple must represent the temple well. See that that robe is cleaned." He turned to face the open doors again. "Go, but be back immediately."

"Yes, Magister," Jerin said. He signed the bowl and fist and crossed the few paces to the doors. He stepped from the shadow back into the sunlight. There were people about in the square, but few were doing more than passing through. He was outside the temple. He was without the rank and file of priests. Despite the heat of the early afternoon, Jerin felt cold, and tugged his robe about him tighter. It was the first time he had been outside on his own since that one excursion with Nessa. Inside his head, he could see her face and the darkness of the alley.

Blinking, he dispelled the visions. Jerin looked to his right, and saw the shiny steel surface of the watering can, still sitting in a drying puddle of water. He scurried over to it. The side was dented from the fall. Jerin looked up at the gardens overhead from where he had dropped it. A sense of vertigo gripped Jerin, thinking of what might have happened if he hadn't caught himself. He would have been worse than dented.

Jerin shivered and returned inside the temple. He raised the watering can to show the priest, who nodded serenely. Jerin returned to his duties, and by being cautious, he managed to finish his rounds without further risk to his life.

Later, he knelt in the open roof area where the groundskeeper shed was, and watched as the sun lowered towards the edge of the roof, which was surrounded by a low wall. The gravel under his knees was uncomfortable, but he was too tired to care. He waited for his dismissal in silence. The dinner bell had rung some time ago, but Tulan had made it clear that Jerin was to finish his duties before being dismissed. The old gardener was inside the shed. It had a side that opened, and Tuan was standing at the work bench, mixing one of his fertilizer compounds. He did not acknowledge Jerin kneeling behind him, and Jerin did not dare to interrupt. Idly, he noted that Pol was down and in the direction of the mess hall. His whole body was tired and sore, but the sense of direction to Pol hadn't wavered or weakened.

When Tulan did turn around, he wiped his hands on the front of his robe again. Jerin was beginning to think that it was permanently stained with earth. It shocked Jerin that any priest would wipe his hands on the symbol of Melior without regard for the blasphemy.

"Finished, did you?"

Jerin nodded, his head swaying loosely on his neck.

"You'll be back tomorrow." It wasn't a question. Both the priest and Jerin knew what Q'docet had written. The priest turned again, and Jerin assumed he was dismissed. He made it to his feet with some effort, and stumbled his way to the ladder than led down from the rooftop into the temple.

He had to beg for dinner from the kitchen. The dinner hour was long past, and none of the staff were impressed by the dirt-stained, yellow-haired boy at the door. Eventually Jerin convinced them that he had been detained by Tulan, and they relented. The cook pointed towards a stack of bowls and told him to serve himself. Once he had gulped down the tepid stew and a rind of bread, Jerin had to head to the laundry. His robe was in a frightful state. He forsook the main corridors and took to the secret ways to move through the temple so as to avoid any priests on the way.

He was finished his cleaning just before the curfew bell rang, and the lights were already out in the dorm when he slipped in. He climbed past Pol's bunk and into his own and was unconscious before he could say his evening prayers.

The next day was a replay for Jerin. And so was the day after. The fourth day in the gardener's service, it rained. Jerin had never been so glad for rain in his life. The rain meant that he did not have to cart water to the gardens. But the relief was only temporary: Tulan started him in weeding. Within a half hour, Jerin was soaked to his skin and had mud up to his elbows. He tried to keep his robe clean, but by midday, it was a brown, stained mess. He made to go to the mess hall when the bell rang, but Tulan stopped him.

"You can't go to the hall dressed like that, they'll cane you." So Jerin spent his lunch break shivering under the shed roof, eating a piece of bread and cheese that Tulan gave him. At the end of the day, he was shivering so fiercely a that he went immediately to the baths and dropped into the water as soon as he had heated enough. Then it was to the laundry, to try to salvage his robe before the stains were permanent. Dinner was well past by the time he was done.

He went to the kitchens. By now the staff was used to Jerin arriving well after the rest had eaten, so he was ignored.

The next morning, the light coming in the windows of the dorm room woke him. His first waking thought, before he opened his eyes, was to decide if the light meant sun and the prospect of scrabbling around the heights of the temple, or rain and whatever dirty and cold job that would bring. Opening one eye, Jerin could see sun bouncing off the wall opposite the window.

Sun. It was watering cans and vertigo.

No one but Pol tried to talk to Jerin in the dorm or at breakfast. Even Hume and the others left him alone. Nobody understood what was being done to Jerin. It was not a punishment that had ever been employed before. He had always been the outcast, and that separation was now being perfected.

"It's no picnic without you around," grumbled Pol as they dressed in the dorm. "I suppose I shouldn't complain, but I'm the target for the others, now."

"I'll trade you," said Jerin. He settled his robe and tied the belt. He wondered if it would be possible to get an acolyte robe in some colour other than white. The black that the teachers wore would hide the dirt so much better.

"Yeah, I know you would," said Pol. "Let me know if I can do anything."

Jerin was grateful that Pol was there, but after a hurried breakfast, he had to make his way to the rooftops while the rest of the Twelfth Order went to choir practice.

Besides Pol, the only person who ever talked to him was the grumpy old gardener. Tulan was at the shed and waiting when Jerin arrived, as usual. Jerin bowed and signed to him, then fetched his watering can from the shelf. When he turned with the can, Jerin was surprised to find the old priest standing there. He wasn't looking at Jerin, but Jerin didn't feel it would be polite to try to dodge around him. So he stood and waited.

Eventually the priest spoke.

"You've done well, and with less complaining that I expected." Jerin didn't know what to say to that. It wasn't quite a compliment, so he just lowered his eyes. Tulan straightened his always-stooped back.

"Do you realize what an insult your teacher has done me?" Jerin started and looked directly at the gardener. "To treat my chosen pursuit as a punishment for a boy he wants to wash out of the Order?" He spat on the ground to the side. "That's what he wants, you know that, right?"

Jerin thought about it for a moment, then nodded. He had already known that he would only ever be raised well after the rest of the boys his age, if he was lucky. What if Q'docet wanted to be rid of him entirely? He stroked his ruined palm.

"If he wanted that, Magi— Tulan, he could just turn me out." Tulan did look at him, at that.

"What, no protests of devotion to the Order? No rising to the defence of a man who has been like a father to you since you were a babe?" Jerin hardened at the words, but just set his jaw and met the gardener's gaze. "No, he can't just turn you out. He was instructed by the Bellatori Primus of the Third Army himself to take care of you. No, he could no more turn you out of the temple than jump off its walls and fly."

Jerin didn't know what his face said, but Tulan smiled. It wasn't a kind smile. It was a bitter smile of knowing that a hated rival was in a tight spot.

"He's never told you of the story of how you came to be here, has he?" Jerin shook his head. "Why do you think that is?" Again, Jerin had had no answer.

"He's stuck with you, that's why. An ugly yellow-haired orphan saved from the conquests of the Third Army. Placed in his care by the man who has now risen to the first position in our Order. He has done everything to neglect you, but if you were turned away or killed, he would forever worry that our supreme commander, Rastus the Fourth, would find out and hold him responsible."

"The Third Army?" said Jerin. He still hadn't quite caught up. He was stuck on the idea of having been saved by an army. The groundskeeper chuckled. He turned away from Jerin, and pulled his pipe and tobacco from his pocket inside his robe. With dirty hands, he thumbed it full. Checking the draw, he lit a twig on the lamp that was hanging inside his shed.

"You're not from around here," he puffed on the pipe to get it lit, "you figured that much out, right?" Even that, Jerin wasn't sure of.

"I thought…" He didn't want to say it aloud. "I thought I was some sort of freak, an aberration."

"There's as many different colours of skin and hair in this world as you can imagine, boy. Yours was as common as dirt where you came from, take my word for it."

"Where?" asked Jerin. It was too much. He just couldn't picture it.

"I don't remember where it was now, not exactly. It isn't there anymore anyways. Just another place that used to have a name. Wiped out by the Third Army. Don't remember why. I doubt no one but the historians do, now. Some perceived slight to Melior, no doubt." He paused, and re-lit his pipe.

Tulan walked across the rooftop, to where the low wall separated the roof from the drop to the streets below. The view faced the East. The sun was well-risen above the horizon and was throwing the silhouette of the city's buildings into stark relief. Tulan took his pipe from his mouth and used the stem to point.

"Out there, that's where you came from. It was far enough away to not have been swallowed up a long time ago, but close enough that it couldn't last forever." He turned away from the view and leaned against the wall, puffing away contemplatively.

"Did they bring other people back?" Jerin asked. "Am I not the only one?"

"Bring back?" Tulan spat. Some of the saliva didn't break away freely and landed on the symbol on his priest's robe. He smeared it absently. "No one ever gets brought back. No one is left alive and no one is brought back. Maybe somebody survived. Hid or escaped before the army attacked maybe. But no one is left alive when Rastus had a mind to punish someone."

For a moment, Jerin felt a flash of hope that maybe his parents were alive, somewhere. That he might have parents alive in the world had never even crossed his mind before. It must have been on his face, because the gardener spoke again.

"No, they aren't alive, boy. I heard the story the same as all the rest did when the army returned. The boy who was a sign of Melior' will. There was some sort of event. Something that made the commander spare you, when everyone else was put to the sword. Including your family, I'm afraid. Father, mother, sister."

"A sister?" He had a sister? Jerin had trouble imagining it.

"Never you mind that. Your name's N'patri now, and you'd better accept that. But you can see where Q'docet's in a bind. He couldn't exactly get rid of the child that was a sign worthy of and recognized by the commander, the Bellatori Primus of the Third Army. You might not be anything today, but you are a reminder of something in the past." He waved Jerin away. "Go on, you've only got so much daylight and lots to do."

Jerin had a large amount to think about. For some reason, the work didn't seem so bad today, and the day was over long before he had come to grips with the idea that he had had a family, dead twelve years.

## Breaking Point: Age Fifteen

Jerin was surprised at how long Q'docet left him to work with the keeper of the grounds. The summer had passed, and autumn was almost over when the priest appeared in the dorm room, to tell Jerin that he was to resume his studies with his order.

By that time, Jerin had ceased to recognize the work as punishment. There was a certain satisfaction in the labour. Jerin was sleeping more soundly than he ever remembered, and for the first time since he had been injured, he was learning to make some use of his hand. It was still useless for delicate work such as writing, but he had learned to carry and hold onto things with it.

Pol had stopped his hovering at morning and night. Perhaps he too had realized that whatever the reasons that had sent his friend to the rooftops and walls, the effect was a strengthening of the young man.

He and Tulan had established a sort of mutual understanding, if not a true friendship. Tulan never gave Jerin an easy day, but he was never cruel about it. In the gardener, Jerin found a fellow outcast. Perhaps the gardener was outcast for his own decisions instead of his birth, but neither he nor the older priest were welcome among their peers.

What had changed was Jerin's perspective. Tulan's story of how Jerin had come to the temple had altered the entire world inside Jerin's mind. Day after day, he had turned the words over and over in his thoughts. Tulan had never elaborated. When Jerin had prompted, Tulan had insisted that he did not know any more. He remembered the circumstances Jerin's arrival, but no more.

Soon, Jerin had realized that he was faced with a dilemma. He had had parents. He had had a sister. In his heart, he believed that his work for the Order would give him the promised life everlasting. But Tulan was certain that his parents and the rest of the people where they lived had been executed for blasphemy. That meant that his family was gone, into the abyss from where no soul returns.

To have learnt of their existence and their damnation in one swift stroke weighed on Jerin. He found himself troubled that those who had brought him into the world and loved him would be lost to him forever. On the few days where he found some time in the evenings before retiring, Jerin went to the Library and searched for loopholes in the Words.

Jerin also had a perspective on Q'docet that he had never had before. Instead of a distant and hash father, Jerin began to see him as a small person torn between his hatred and his duty to the temple. Jerin had no illusions that Q'docet could and would make his life as difficult as possible, but there was a sense that it wasn't Jerin's fault anymore. He finally understood the circumstances that had brought himself and the priest together and that made a difference.

Jerin was almost sorry to leave and resume his studies, but the season was over and there was relatively little to do with the gardens before the snow would fly. If Q'docet or the Eldests had noticed a change in Jerin's demeanour, none of them had mentioned it. Unconsciously, Jerin was carrying himself more upright and that presence translated into less bullying from the others.

Pol was glad to have his friend back. While he had been his usual glib and fast-moving self, he still was recognized as the friend of an outcast. Pol didn't volunteer any stories of the time when Jerin was gone, but when Jerin asked, he was sure that Pol was holding unpleasant things back.

The time spent working with his hands had given Jerin plenty of practice figuring out how to use his ruined one. He had spent months working with tools of all shapes and sizes, and the return to the usual rounds of chores that the acolytes were tasked to do seemed so much simpler now. He even managed to start progressing in the weapons classes that led to the warrior ranks. Jerin had no particular urge to become one of the warrior priests, but it was a class that he was no longer automatically poor at.

The strange bond with Pol hadn't disappeared, either. Neither had come up with an explanation, and it just became a weird unsolved mystery to them. Neither of them had tried to enter the relic room again. It had been fine adventure for them. Now that he knew more about his abandonment to the care of the priests, Jerin was firmly of the opinion that he would be old before he ever saw the relic again. He no longer believed that he might be raised as a priest. He had experienced the relic once, and once had been enough.

Jerin's body started to change with his age. His voice dropped the expected amount, and his frame started to fill in. He started getting hair in new places. It was light-coloured, of course. Perhaps if he hadn't had the time with Tulan, he might have resented it as more signs of his strangeness. But to him, it was just another sign that he was only a visitor in a land that had adopted him, but not welcomed him.

He also started thinking about girls. He didn't have much contact with them. In fact the only one he had ever spent any time with had been Nessa. The priests preached that women were the original betrayer of Melior, and caused his long imprisonment in the northern fortress of Nakt Dhelai. A moment of weakness led to five years of torment. The woman's mind was empty, but when filled grew in a corrupt jungle of vile things. And yet they were necessary for procreation and could be effective workers if trained properly.

Each night, the acolytes recited the prayer for strength to resist the urges of the flesh and to direct those energies into Melior' holy work. Some of the boys took it to heart. Ayb F'ortiter was one. He was had always been larger and stronger, and he had put his mind to becoming a warrior priest. Long hours he stayed in the training areas, pushing his body as far as it would go. Sometimes there was a slightly distracted look in Ayb's eye, and then he would redouble his efforts. It was not an exaggeration to say he fell into his bunk each night absolutely exhausted.

Others started disappearing from time to time. As acolytes, the boys had never been alone. It was abnormal when some of their number started making themselves scarce for brief periods. One such was his nemesis, Hume F'rubeus. Jerin found it very hard to stop himself from following Hume to see where he went. He felt an overpowering urge to pay him back for the time so long ago when he had been discovered with Nessa.

Jerin was content to embrace the urges that his body was sending him. When he listened to the words that the priests said, he thought about his time with Nessa. It disturbed him when he found himself doubting the words. Perhaps the story about Melior was right. Yes, there were passages in the Words that specifically forbade the pleasures of the flesh. But Jerin had a picture in his mind of what a female was, and in Nessa's case, that had been intelligent, fun and adventurous.

"But you have to admit that she got you in terrible trouble," pointed out Pol one evening when he and Jerin were playing a game of cards in the dorm. The lights were low, and the shutters were drawn against the spring evening chill.

"Trouble is trouble," said Jerin. "I also learned a lot from her, and I had some of the best times of my childhood with her. This," he said, raising his hand, "I lay at Q'docet's feet, not hers."

"Shh," said Pol looking around to see if anyone was close enough to hear. "You talk like that and you might lose the use of the other one." He quickly dispelled evil with the sign of the bowl and the fist.

Nevertheless, in the evenings when he felt the urges that his maturing body was sending his way, it was Nessa's face that appeared in his minds' eye.

Amid the changes in his body, Jerin was starting to wonder if he was hallucinating. From time to time, he felt presences in the room. They always passed. It happened at any time of the day, no matter what Jerin was doing. They were a similar sensation to his link with Pol, but they felt different, somehow. They were neither a push or a pull, just a moving sensation of something in the room that passed. Unlike when Pol was sitting beside Jerin in prayer, or asleep in his bunk below him in the dorm, these sensations were always moving. Jerin was willing to believe that they were illusions, but his link with Pol was a precedent that he couldn't ignore.

He didn't get a chance to mention these strange sensations to Pol before something happened.

Jerin and the rest of the Twelfth Order were in the training rooms, practicing the use of a short walking stick in self-defence. The room was one of the largest training rooms in the temple.  It was used sometimes to train entire squads at the same time.  It had a high roof: fully high enough to train with pole arms. The walls were lined with racks of weapons and illustrations of some of the techniques that were taught by the instructors here. The floor was hard, unlike the room where they learned hand-to-hand fighting. It made the sounds echo as the acolytes attempted to imitate the instructor.

The instructor was Captain Decco, one of the soldiers from the Second Army. He was not a priest: he was a regular in the army. He also ran the training for the troops in the army. He had a rough side of his tongue that he didn't restrain because he was teaching acolytes. In their early lessons, Hume had mouthed off at Decco.

"You watch yourself, soldier. It won't be long until we will be commanding you." Hume said. Decco didn't react the way Jerin expected. He didn't even make eye contact with Hume: he only continued to demonstrate the correct way to hold a spear high in a defensive posture.

"If I do my job correctly, by that time you'll realize how pathetic you were to threaten a man who was doing his best to help you." It was delivered in such a level tone that it brought Hume up short, but didn't disrupt the lesson. It reminded everyone that Decco wasn't just an instructor, but a man who had seen battle and survived.

The acolytes learned how to use all of the weapons that a warrior might need, but Jerin liked the walking stick more than most. He never intended to be a warrior, and he could see the utility of being able to defend himself with a stick. He also liked it because it was entirely about defending himself. He had to do the exercises with his left hand instead of his right, but that wasn't as much of an impedance as for some of the other weapons.

There had just been an accident: Feri was down with a blow to the head, administered by his sparring partner Jakab. Such accidents weren't uncommon, and everyone was waiting while Decco saw to the boy. Jakab was hovering, looking worried.

Jerin felt the approach of yet another one of these strange presences. He looked in the direction of its approach. He was curious, but didn't expect to see anything. Jerkin was surprised when he determined that it was moving almost directly towards him. That had never happened before: they had transited his space but hadn't come close. He looked at the rest of the class, but they were too preoccupied with the fallen boy to notice anything. Jerin moved a few steps away from the class. He was right in the line of motion of the sensation. It was moving fast: they always were. Jerin had felt it long before it entered the bounds of the training room, and from the time that he felt it enter the large room, it was only seconds until it reached him.

Now that he was in its path, Jerin had no idea what to do. Instinctively, he held out a hand with his fingers spread wide, as though to grasp something. There was a tickling sensation, and a pressure built in Jerin's hand. It was almost like something was stretching, and it was stuck to his palm. He was now straining against the pressure. It was building, and he didn't think he was strong enough to hold it much longer. He turned and pivoted away from the force, and he felt it leave his hand. The pressure was released.

There was a loud crack from the wall of the training room. Jerin flinched from the sound. It was like a whip crack but amplified. The sensation of a presence disappeared into the distance, heading away in the opposite direction from which it came. The sound was still echoing around the training room when Jerin realized a that all activity had come to a halt. Every pair of eyes was staring at the wall.

Where there had been a weapons rack affixed to the stone, there was now a pile of kindling. Wood splinters had flown out from the point of impact. There was an expanding cloud of powdered stone. When it cleared, it was clear that the surface of the stone wall was gouged. When Jerin had let go, the force of a battering ram had been directed against the wall.

No one was looking at Jerin, as he was standing well away from the point of impact. Soon a clamour of voices started talking and asking the instructor questions he couldn't answer. Everyone started crowding around the remains of the weapons rack, but Jerin hung back. Pol joined him, and they both stood and watched. Jerin was trying to piece together what had happened. It seemed certain that he had done this, but he could not fathom how.

He looked around at all of the other acolytes and Decco poking at the remains of the weapons rack. Ayb picked up a steel spearhead that was now only attached to a hand's length of splintered oak. Whatever had happened, it was not a hallucination. Hallucinations did not nearly knock holes in stone walls.

"Everyone return to the dorm," said Decco, raising his voice above the hubbub. There were grumbles from the boys, but everyone complied and made their way out of the training room. Halfway to the dorm, one of the head priests came across the gaggle of acolytes and stopped them.

"What are you doing out of lessons?" the priest asked, his eyes shifting from face to face.

There was confusion as each boy tried to describe what had happened. When the priest had heard enough, a look of alarm widened his eyes. He admonished the boys to return to the dorm immediately and then hurried in the opposite direction to see for himself whet had happened.

Once they were back in the dorm, Pol flopped down on his bunk. "That was beyond weird," he said. "I was reading the other day about the idea of a supernatural intrusion, where for a brief moment, our world and the world beyond touch. I wonder if that was what that was."

"Where did you read that?" asked Jerin, leaning against the post that supported his bunk above. It didn't sound like what had happened, but he was willing to entertain any idea at this point.

"Was one of the texts I transcribed a couple years ago," he said. I asked the priest about it at the time. He said that it was a discredited idea. Some theologian or other had conclusively proven that the Words of Melior ruled out any connection between worlds. Only the release of the soul from the flesh permitted crossing, After death."

A dead end. That didn't help Jerin at all. He had to figure this out on his own. He could only think of one way to do it. Most of the other boys were gathered near the doors to the dorm still. Jerin looked down towards the other end of the dorm. There was a large fireplace at that end, and an assortment of furniture. There also was a coal stove. The fireplace was an extravagance that the acolytes didn't get to enjoy. The fireplace was never used.

"Come on," said Jerin. He headed down the hall towards the fireplace. Pol grumbled, but he got up and followed. Since leaving the training room, Jerin had sensed many more of the movIng sensations. It was almost making him dizzy, with so many sensations pulling on him at once. They were faint, not nearly as powerful as the link to Pol. None had come anywhere near him, but it seemed only a matter of time and patience. The great number of them surprised Jerin. Normally, he might sense only a few per day. But at the moment, there were eight that he was aware of, and they were drifting in and out of his perception. He closed his eyes and recounted. Now there were nine. Each was moving in a different direction, although they seemed to he drifting from east to west more than anything.

Jerin stopped in front of the massive stone fireplace. It was made of mortared river stone. Each stone in the fireplace showed intricate veining of the minerals inside. When he got there, he turned and scanned in all directions. Nothing was near, except for the link with Pol. Again, he wondered if there was some sort of connection between the two phenomena. Pol was there, and looking at Jerin for an explanation. Jerin felt one of the things approaching. It was still far off, but coming closer. Jerin turned to face it.

The east wall had a large tapestry covering it, but Jerin was ignoring it. He felt the direction of the sensation start to drift upwards. With some disappointment, he realized that it was going to miss high. He could feel whatever it was changing its angle upwards. He kept his eyes on it. Pol came and stood next to his friend, looking in the same direction.

"What are we looking et?" he asked.

"Shh," said Jerin. The sensation passed through the upper wall at high speed. He expected to see nothing, but there was a... ripple. It wasn't really anything, more like the distortion in water, like when a boat cut through it. That wasn't quite right, because the ripples from a boat spread in a V from the prow and sides, whereas this was a straight line. A line cut through the room just under the rafters. Jerin watched it, and then it was through the opposite wall and gone. If that had been something solid, then the whole roof of the dorm should live been sheared clean off, but the roof was still in one piece.

"Jer, are you okay?"

"I'm fine. Just wait." He watched these threads moving. To his surprise, there were more of them now: at lead least ten that he could sense.

"Is that old wound on your head acting up?" Jerin couldn't help but smile at the question. He knew he was acting insane. But he wasn't. There was something going on here. It was something that was larger than they could see.

There it was. There was another one of these things was heading toward them. Where the last one had been cutting horizontally, this one was vertical, like the one that he had caught in the training room. Jerin took a few steps away from the fire place. It was going to come right through this spot. He checked the wall that was behind him. The west wall was another made of the ubiquitous stone of the temple. This one had a shelf with twin candlesticks on it, as well as a replica of the bowl and sphere in pewter. Perhaps he should be careful.

"Here it comes," said Jerin under his breath. This one was moving faster, and was… thinner, if that was a good word for something you couldn't see. Jerin held out his hand as he had done in the training room. He almost missed: this one was moving much faster. Is soon as he felt the sensation of force building in his left hand, Jerin pivoted out of the way and released it.

Immediately, there was a whip crack of sound. The candle sticks on the shelf rattled, hut nothing was destroyed. Jerin grinned as he looked at Pol. Pol's face was shocked.

"What did you just do?" he asked breathlessly.

"I don't know." said Jerin.

After dinner, Pol and Jerin found a quiet corner of the temple and Jerin did his best to explain what had happened. Jerin didn't try to demonstrate, though he saw several of the lines cut through the space while they were talking. He tried to point them out to his friend, but Pol could never see them. They were even more numerous now, and there was more variety in their size, speed and direction.

## No Way Forward: Age Seventeen

Over the next two years, Jerin and Pol had worked together to try to under stand this thing that Jerin could do. Much of the time, that consisted of launching small objects off the temple roof. It was great fun trying to clear the outer wall of the city with an egg, for example. Jerin never could figure out any pattern in the lines of force that were constantly drifting through the temple.

Pol got him to try to figure out how far away they were when he was first aware of them. It was very difficult to estimate, given that they arrived randomly and he was only gradually aware of them. It was well beyond the bounds of the city, at a minimum. The bigger ones he was aware of first. For a number of weeks it had seemed that the numbers of lines was increasing all the time, but then it levelled off. After the fact, Jerin attributed it to becoming more sensitive to them, and being able to detect finer ones, whereas at first he had only been able to sense the largest.

He was now able to see them much more clearly. He still could sense them much a farther away than he could see them, but when they were close, they were obvious to him. They were always perfectly straight, as though they were wires stretched tight between two infinitely distant objects. When Jerin caught hold of one, it did not seem to bend at the point of his touch, but the pressure increased until Jerin no longer had the strength to hold on.

The few times that he had tried to hold on to the strings too long, the resulting release of energy was like an explosion, or a thunderclap. Anticipating the noise, Jerin had done this on the roof of the temple. Pol and he had hidden afterwards, laughing to themselves as they watched priests and acolytes come onto the roof, looking into the clear blue sky for the source of the thunder.

Beyond their games, there seemed to be no useful purpose for this gift. The strings were too random in their arrival to be able to use them on demand, and the force they generated was directed in the direction of their original trajectory. If Jerin wanted to launch an object across the mess hall at Hume, he had no choice but to wait for a thread to line up in the right direction at the right spot. Lunch was over long before these coincided.

Eventually, like the link with Pol, it was something that Jerin got used to. It was like living in a lattice of the lines of force, a constantly-changing cat's cradle of strings that formed and reformed around him. The only constant was that link with Pol. It was always there, drawing a straight line to his friend. When he considered it, he thought it was strange to see, projecting from his chest, side or back depending where Pol was relative to him. he couldn't say that the line had a colour, it was just an aberration of his sight along the line.

None of the books either of them read shed any light on it, either. The books on supernatural phenomena were dominated by the acts that Melior and his archangels had been able to perform, but they didn't sound anything like the ability to randomly lob eggs as far as the wall of the city. In the end, it didn't really change the facts of Jerin's existence. He was rapidly approaching the age at which boys from his Order would start being selected to be raised to the priesthood. There were still boys from the previous orders who had not yet been raised, but they were few, and the reasons for their continued rejection were obvious, for the most part. Some were just too dim to be considered seriously for a position. Others were unable to follow rules and were a high risk to dishonour the temple. In each Order, there were some few who were never raised. They either left voluntarily or were asked to leave by age twenty.

Jerin was starting to evaluate his options. There had been no sign from any of the teaching priests, Q'docet included, that their attitude towards him had changed at all. Without some form of change, Jerin aid not stand a chance of being raised.

His options weren't good. His handicap would prevent him from following many paths, such as a soldier in the armies or a weaver, even if he had proven more capable than most would give him credit for. He had doubled down on his academic studies. There was a chance that a priesthood-level education would see him through outside the temple. The biggest worry was whether or not he could cope outside the temple walls. Many of the other acolytes had family on the outside, and visits to them gave them valuable experience with the outside world, where Jerin had absolutely none.

He spent hours standing on the roof of the temple, looking over the retaining wall, staring down at the streets of the city that were visible from his vantage point. People would come and go, vendors would erect temporary shelters and tables to hawk wares. Business would be conducted, laundry would be hung between the buildings in the alleyways. The buildings constructed in Lagroth tended towards three stories: the first used for shops and workshops of various kinds, and the upper floors were living quarters. The main roads were paved with flagstone, but anything off the main reads was packed earth. Jerin could see a little ways down some of the twisting alleyways, but the haphazard layout of buildings meant that his lines of sight were always foreshortened. The constant energy of the streets was overwhelming, even from this distance.

He was not allowed to go out of the temple unescorted for any reason, but he did make the attempt to get as close as he could. He started volunteering for any job that took him into the entrance hall, where he could see the square in front of the gates through the open gates. A few times per day, petitioners would come and speak to the priest who sat in the chair just inside the doors. Jerin was technically not supposed to listen, since the petition was private and trusted to the priest's ears, but he couldn't help himself. This was his only opportunity to get used to the presence of outside folk.

Most of the petitions were of a spiritual nature. Someone wanting to have a blessing on their newest child, or a few words said in prayer for a new business venture. Occasionally, a dispute would be brought that the Council had deemed unworthy of legal action. These Jerin listened to eagerly. They were his best insight into the life outside the walls. Some were the issues that arose from the crowded conditions in the city: sights, sounds and smells of neighbours offending those around them. Others were monetary, but with no legal documentation to capture the interest of the courts. Once when Jerin was present, a man had brought his wife in to ask for the dissolution of their marriage. The priest had refused. The husband wished to marry another. The priest had cited the Words that forbade more than one marriage.

The idea of marriage fascinated Jerin. To spend so much time with a woman seemed strange. Jerin hadn't ever spoken to one, and hadn't really spent time with a girl since he and Nessa had been caught. That was over seven years ago, now. Jerin was sure that he was not cut out for the celibate life of a priest: he was fascinated by the women he could see in the streets from the rooftop, and the few who he saw enter the temple. He didn't even have a working knowledge of what women were hiding under their clothes, but the way the bulky fabrics hinted at very un-masculine curves kept him up at night. Some few acolytes had quit the temple. Pol had heard that some had gotten married, including Feri, from Jerin's Twelfth Order.

On this particular day, Jerin had managed to get assigned to polishing the brass fittings for the lamps along the entrance hall. It was dirty, tiring work, but with any luck there would be petitioners, and that would take his mind off of it. When two silhouettes appeared in the doorways to the entry hall, Jerin had already finished two of the lamp holders and was moving his ladder to reach a third.

One figure was taller and thicker than the other, and as soon as the people had walked up to the priest, Jerin could see that he was an older man with grey in his hair, and he was accompanied by a young woman. She acted as a woman might, approaching a priest: she had her hair covered and her head down. Jerin did his best to not be overt in his eavesdropping, and didn't stare. Probably another blessing for a marriage, he thought as he put his ladder in place and started climbing.

His foot missed the rung and Jerin almost fell off the ladder when the man spoke. "Malth F'craven," the man said in answer to the priest's inquiry, "and Nessa F'malth." It took all of Jerin's will to not immediately turn around on the ladder and look to see if it was the Nessa he knew. She had told him her patronymic once, but he could not remember it. It could have been F'malth.

"I have a request," said Malth. "My daughter is as well-read as she can be with the books available to her. I know it's unusual, but I would like her to be able to access the library here in the temple." Jerin could guess the priest's answer before he gave it.

"Such an arrangement is impossible," he said, without any trace of irritation or other emotion. "Women, young or old are not permitted in the temple. Did you give her name as Nessa F'malth?" There was a note of interest in the priest's tone. "Is she not the one who was discovered trespassing on these grounds…" the priest trailed off, as though trying to remember the details of the event.

"Yes, I know that there is some history there," said Nessa's father, "but that only goes to show my point. She is motivated."

"She was found trespassing and was lashed before being released with a prohibition against returning."

"Yes, well, she had had has accepted that punishment and observed the restriction, Magister." Malth's voice was thinner, and didn't sound nearly as confident as it had when he first spoke. Perhaps he hadn't expected the priest to have direct knowledge of his daughter's transgression.

How many girls does he think we find trespassing in the temple? thought Jerin. It had been almost eight years ago, and still the priests and other acolytes chastised him for it.

Jerin had finished polishing this lamp fixture, and descended his ladder. When he turned to collect his polishing kit from the floor at the foot of the ladder, he stole a glance at the petitioning couple. He only spared a fraction of a second for Malth F'craven. He was as he thought: greying, a modest beard and a thickness around his middle that spoke of a relatively comfortable life. It was the daughter that he reserved his attention for. The light was not favourable, with the glare from the outside throwing shadows. But where Malth's attention was on the priest in front of him, his daughter was looking straight at Jerin.

He looked away quickly, bending to fetch his polishing kit. The face had been of a girl who might have been his age. She was dressed simply, with a cotton dress and a dark-colored wrap over it. Despite the modest shapelessness of the wrap, Jerin's eyes assessed that she was slim and well-proportioned. Her face was attractive. Eight years was a long time. His memories of his time exploring the temple with his girl friend were sometimes fuzzy, but there was no mistaking the young woman's face that had grown from the girl he had known.

He stole another glance when he straightened, but she was no longer looking at him. Jerin proceeded to move his supplies and ladder to the next fixture. The priest rejected the request. He also added a reminder that Nessa's special barring from the temple was in place. While it was obvious that no woman should ever enter the temple, she was facing special sanctions if ever she entered the place.

"This includes the entrance hall," he added.

"Yes Magister," said her father, and he ducked his head, putting fist to forehead.

"The particular circumstances of her trespass have not been forgotten, either, citizen. I recommend you marry her off to someone with a firm hand as soon as can be arranged," he said with a dismissive wave.

Perhaps he should have left at that point, but Malth added a parting shot. "I would, but as your priest damaged her back so badly, that's a problem."

The priest rose from his chair. Aware that he had overstepped, Malth made a hasty retreat, pulling his daughter with him. Jerin, who had stopped all pretence of not observing, saw the disdainful look that Nessa shot the priest before she dutifully followed her father. When they had exited the temple, the priest returned to his chair, and noticed Jerin there, ladder in hand.

He looked directly at Jerin. For a moment, his look was a cool one that was meant to make an acolyte scurry off, but then there was a look of recognition. He glanced away, toward the open door and then back to Jerin. His eyes narrowed slightly.

Jerin imagined that the priest was making the connection between the yellow-haired acolyte before him and the special circumstances that the girl had been found in when caught trespassing so many years before. Jerin saluted quickly and proceeded to finish his polishing job as soon as he was able. It was not easy to remain cool, when imagining those knowing eyes burning holes into his back. He very much doubted that this would be the last he would hear of this.

Jerin caught up with Pol in the mess hall that evening. They waited patiently while the prayer was intoned, then Jerin started telling Pol about the encounter as soon as the clatter of utensils on dishes and idle chatter had risen in the hall.

"I really don't know why you bother, Jer," said Pol stuffing a piece of bread into his mouth and talking around it. "There isn't a person on this world who has done you more harm, yet you keep getting involved." Jerin dismissed this.

"The library, Pol. You remember how I used to smuggle books to her?"

"Yes, I do, and quite frankly I wish I could forget."

"She wanted to come to study here."

"Well, at least she has learned that the right way into the temple is the front door and not the laundry chute." The conversation died as a priest came walking down the aisle. It was Q'sammal, one of the other teachers. He stopped immediately behind Jerin. Jerin kept his head clown, and eating. Nothing happened, and the priest moved off down the aisle.

Jerin looked at the other boys at their table. They were all looking at he and Pol. Perhaps they were disappointed as being robbed of entertainment. Soon they were back in their own conversations, except one. The boy directly across the table from Jerin stood. For a moment, he made eye contact with Jerin, then smirked. He turned and left the table.

"Why you would risk your neck over a girl is beyond me," said Pol in a whisper. "Dim, illiterate and likely unwashed." Jerin stopped watching the boy who had left. He turned slowly to face Pol.

"Take that back."

"What?" Pol said around a mouthful of potato.

"I said take that back."

"Take what back?"

"I get enough of the blind hate from the others, I don't need to hear it parroted by you. Take it back." Jerin felt his heart racing. What was he doing? Pol was his only friend in this place. But it was what had to be said. Pol looked at him, scanning his friend's face.

Jerin didn't know that he was ready to strike out at Pol, but that is what he did. Pol was on his right, and with a sweep of his arms, he knocked pol backwards and to the flagstone tiles of the hall, his dinner showering down on top of him. Jerin stood as quickly as he could, getting hung up on the bench in the process, and Pol scrambled to his feet. Immediately, there was a crowd around them. Pol wiped the remains of his food from his robe, not taking a fighting stance. Jerin had his hands up, but did not rush in to attack. There were sporadic cheers of "Fight!" from the surrounding boys, but mostly from those in the back who could not see what was going on. The space between Jerin and Pol did not close.

Pol pushed his hear hair back out of his eyes and fixed Jerin with a stare. "She'd better be worth it," was all he said.

He turned, and dumbfounded the boys forming the circle made a path for the much smaller boy to leave. Jerin felt foolish. All of the crowd was looking at him. There had been no fight. But there had been damage. Jerin had done his friendship a grievous harm, only it couldn't be seen.

Soon, Q'sammal approached, and the crowd melted away as quickly as they could. His eyes searched for the other combatant, but there was none to be found.

Q'sammal stood before Jerin, who flushed and wouldn't meet the priest's eyes.

"Picking on the smallest, N'patri?" Jerin's eyes snapped to the priest's and he opened his mouth to protest, but Q'sammal stifled it with an upraised finger.

"Penance, N'patri. Recite the Words five times before bed each night this week. And pay particular attention to the fifty-seventh. The dishonour of being small and suppressing the weak."

Jerin fought his emotions into line and made the fist and bowl sign as the priest turned a cold back to him. He wanted to find his friend and apologize, but then he remembered what it was that Pol had said.

"Burn him," muttered Jerin, and he sat back down at the table. He looked up and the smirking boy across the table was back and seated again. Jerin thought his name might be Franc, but he was four years Jerin's junior and all acolytes in the temple went out of their way to avoid him. Franc was still smirking, and looking straight at Jerin.

Jerin quirked an eyebrow, but that only deepened the smirk on his face.

When the meal was done and the acolytes had stood and thanked Melior for it, Jerin made his way out of the mess hall in the jostling crowd. He was wrapped in his own thoughts, angry at his friend, when the first blow came.

Jerin barely had time to react when a shoulder crashed into his right side, throwing him against the stone wall of the corridor. He hit the wall hard. The air rushed from him as he turned to face the assault.

There was Ayb. He was apparently the one who had charged him, and now he was closing again. Behind him was Hume, Jakab, and two of the larger boys of the Eleventh Order. They all had thunderous looks on their faces. They pressed in behind Ayb.

Jerin did his best to deflect Ayb's blows. The other boy was much larger and also was more skilled at fighting. It was only a heartbeat or two before one of Ayb's sizeable fists connected with Jerin's middle. When Jerin doubled up, another blow caught him in the side of the head and the hallway swam.

Kicks rained down on him as he curled up defensively on the floor. Jerin tasted blood.

When they stopped, Ayb leaned down.

"That's for Pol. I never understood why he put up with you." He gave one last kick.

Jerin sensed the boys move away. When he dared to uncover his head and look around, he saw that one had not left. Jerin looked up, squinting through tears.

Hume was there.

"Or perhaps it was talk of a girl that brought this on you, straw-head." He said it with a satisfied tone. "You're weak. You're ugly. You're never going to be raised."

Jerin wasn't prepared for the kick. Hume's foot caught him right in the belly.

## Breaking Curfew: Age Seventeen

<!--

}

Bedtime was not pleasant. Jerin limped into the dorm, but Pol would not speak to Jerin. They were bunk mates and could not get away from the other. Jerin tried to say something, but Pol walked away.

In pain and with no one to share it, Jerin began his recitation of the Words. It was made aloud, but to no one in particular. Sometimes another acolyte would come along and listen for a minute, but no one stayed for it all.

The lights had gone out in the dorm before Jerin finished his fifth recitation. He rose from his knees, and scrambled up into his bunk. There was no customary wish of a good sleep from Pol.

Jerin lay awake. The darkness isolated him, just as he had isolated himself with his actions. He was alone with his pains and his recriminations. He argued with himself, grinding his teeth as he replayed what had happened.

How could he have been so stupid as to alienate his only friend in the temple? And for what? A casual slur against a girl that neither one knew particularly well. Since she was specifically banned from the temple, it was unlikely that either one of them would ever see her again. And yet it wasn't that simple.

Jerin had had few friends, and in his heart, he still counted Nessa as one of them. Jerin felt loyalty to her, despite the circumstances. Whatever she had been, she hadn't been dim. And although she had been illiterate when he met her, she had learned very quickly, and judging from her father's request to the priest today, she had continued to excel.

He had meant what he said. He heard constantly from the priests that women were the repository of evil and chaos, but his experience told him otherwise. In the face of this, the last thing he needed was Pol telling him the same. Yet it didn't matter. It was all nothing, and nothing was all he had. The injustice of it felt like something squeezing his heart.

His ribs ached from the kicking he had received. Jerin couldn't find a comfortable position to lie down. He squirmed in his bunk, and eventually kicked the blanket off. He had to get out of there. He grabbed his robe and shimmied down to the floor. He imagined that he saw Pol's eyes shining in the dark, but he made no sound.

He threw his robe over his shoulders against the chill of the room. He was dressed only in his sleep shirt. He winced as his feet hit the cold floor, and slipped his sandals on before he left. There was no indication from anyone that he was seen leaving, which he took as further evidence that he was essentially invisible to the rest of the population inside the temple. Jerin had no clear notion where he was going, but he could not wander freely without being certain of encountering a priest. Even at age seventeen, the acolytes had a strict curfew. Perhaps it was seeing Nessa again this afternoon, but it seemed like a good idea to prowl the back ways of the temple like they used to do.

It wasn't far to the statue of Levifid, and he hoisted himself up and disappeared into the niche behind.

Pol had been tossing as well. He had heard Jerin moving restlessly in his bunk above. The truth was that he wanted to reach out to him and explain, but doing so would undo what he was trying to accomplish. While Pol did not have the same degree of ostricization as his blond friend, he had always suffered at the smallest boy in their Order, and he was considerably smaller than even the acolytes one or two years younger. But Jerin had never made that an issue, or used his size to bully. The blow at dinner he understood. It was a reaction, and a natural one than that. By rights, Jerin should have followed up by kicking Pol when he was down, but he had a passive streak in him that Pol admired, even if it meant that Jerin would never amount to anything in the temple. The Words of Melior were clear: to the strong went the victory, and the boys in the Order had been urged to compete and accept violence as a normal way of things. But Jerin, with his abnormal coloring, a ruined hand and a peaceful nature was never likely to be raised.

But if his actions tonight, Jerin forgot that girl and focused for this last year or so, maybe there was an outside chance he would make it. Pol heard Jerin rise and saw him climb down to the floor. haybe he imagined it, but he thought that Jerin looked at him for a long moment before he threw his robe on and moved swiftly away. The door to the dorm o-ened and closed and then the silence was only brokent iv the deep breathing of the dozens of boys in the room.

Now what was Jerin up to? He probably needed to blow off some steam. To be honest, Pol felt like he wanted to do the same, but there was no way he would ever risk leaving the dorm after curfew. Pol was just starting to drift into an uneasy sleep when lights came up in the dorm. For an instant, his heart sank, as he thought that Jerin had been caught and was being brought back. He levered up onto his elbow and looked to the source of the light. A priest stood to either side of the doorway, and three more came through the door. Each held a lantern aloft, and they were dressed in their formal robes.

"Oh no,", thought Pol. It wasn't as bad as Jerin being caught, but it wasn't much better. It was a raising. You could never predict when they would happen, but the priests would enter and call the name of one or more acolytes to be summoned for testing. It happened every month or two, and it was Jerin's cursed luck that it would happen only minutes after he had left. There wouldn't be a bed check or a roll call, but there was always the chance that the priests would notice the empty bunk. The only way it could be worse would be if…

"Be it known that tonight a chosen acolyte will be raised to join the priesthood," intoned the priest who had entered last. All five now stood in a row with their lanterns. "If that boy should pass the test, he will become a man in the service of our holy god, Melior. The one who is selected is... Jerin N'patri".

Jerin was now in the passageway that ran along the upper boundary of the Library. He hadn't been here in years. He also doubted that anyone else had, either. The passage had probably been empty since that day when he was nine and had followed Nessa up the bookshelves and out of the Library.

Once he had started supplying her with the books she wanted, neither of them had come this way anymore. As he had explored more of the temple, Jerin had tried to find out why these old, unused passageways existed. The temple had grown over hundreds of years, and sometimes new additions had changed the patterns inside. He had discovered that in the past, this particular passage had led to a raised balcony that ran around the rim of the Library hall. Over time, the balcony had deteriorated and eventually been torn down. That what was why at several points, this passage opened to nothing, at the tops of the highest shelves.

As usual, there was a dim light coming from the hall of the Library. It was one place in the temple that was never completely dark. He supposed it was so that priests could enter at any time and not have to fumble in the dark. One never knew when a theological inspiration would strike, he supposed. He found the opening that was exactly opposite one of the massive bookshelves. He looked down. He remembered leaping across it when he was younger. While he supposed the distance looked shorter now that his legs were longer, the reality of a drop of fifteen to twenty feet or more was seemed riskier. He could picture making the leap, but he shook his head when he remembered it.

He was about to turn and retreat into the dark when he froze. There had been the sound of a chair being pushed back from one of the tables in the centre study area. Someone was in the Library. Jerin moved to the edge and strained to see, but there was no line of sight.

Curious now, he ducked silently back into the passageway and moved along it until he reached the next opening to the nonexistent balcony. From here, he could see straight down a row between shelves to one of the study tables. The heavy wood table was a dim mass in the centre of the hall. It had a lit lantern on it, making a little pool of yellow light. There was a chair at it that had been pushed back, but there was no one seated at it at the moment. Whoever had been there had stepped away. Jerin leaned out, trying to see where they might have gone. Motion caught his eye, and he ducked back. A shadow moved out of the rows on the far side of the library, carrying a book. It was Nessa.

"I don't know where he went," said Pol. "He left only a minute ago." The five priests circled him, looking vaguely inhuman with the paint on their faces, making the hollows like light and the ridges dark. When Jerin hadn't answered the summons, eventually they had come to look for him.

"He's done it again," said a voice from one of the bunks beyond the edge of the lamplight.

"This is unprecedented," muttered one of the priests. They proceeded to question all of the acolytes, but no one had any idea where he was. Only three had seen him leave.

"He will be found," said one of the priests. It sounded like a threat.

Jerin lurked just out of the lamplight in the row between the bookshelves. For a minute, he couldn't bring himself to step out of the shadows. He was content to just look at her. Nessa was absorbed in reading a book. He was surprised she hadn't heard him climbing down the shelves. He could be stealthy when he needed to, but he was sure he had made a fair bit of noise climbing down. For the first time, Jerin got a really good look at her face. It was longer and thinner that it had been all those years ago. It was framed by her dark hair, and one hand was keeping it out of her eyes as she read. Her nose was stronger than her remembered, but it was all her. He didn't want to end this moment.

It was ended for him. When Nessa shifted her position to turn the pages, she spoke to the dark. "I can hear you breathing. Are you going to say hello, Jerin?" Jerin stopped breathing for a moment, then stepped out of the dark. Absently, he rubbed at his right palm as he stood there. She looked up from her book. Doing so, her face fell into shadow, and Jerin could no longer see her eyes clearly. Her entire head and shoulders were lit in a halo of light, while the rest of her was in shadow.

Jerin fidgeted. For the first time, he remembered that he was wearing his night shirt with his robe loosely thrown over it. He tugged it tighter around him.

"Well?" she asked. "Are you?" She waited. "Going to say hello."

Nessa's voice had deepened, it was richer than it had been. It still had a certain street accent to it. He had teased her about it when they were kids.

"H-hello," said Jerin. He cleared his throat. What was wrong with him? He decided to say what was on his mind.

"Why are you here?" Then he decided that wasn't really what he wanted to know. "How are you?" She cocked her head at him.

"Oh, I suppose I'm fine. Eight years, and that's all you have to say to me?" Jerin wanted so many words to come out of his mouth, but they were all jammed up inside, fighting for space. He knew why she hadn't been back after they had been caught. He wouldn't have come back either. But why now?

"I've missed you?" He didn't meant for it to rise as a question, but it did. He could see a smile on her face, despite the shadows.

"I've missed you, too." She nodded towards Jerin's hands. He had been rubbing his injured palm again. "Is that... what he did to you?" Jerin quickly stopped rubbing, and put his hands behind him, hiding his deformity. She wouldn't have it. She rose from her chair, stepped forward and took hold of his forearms. She tugged at them until he let her pull his hand back into the light. She was so close to him. For the first time, he noticed that he was taller than she was. Her hair was right as at his nose level, and a stray wisp tickled his nose at the same time as he caught her scent. He didn't know what he had expected, but Pol's claim that she was unwashed was wrong. It wasn't a flowery scent, or a dirty one. It was just the smell of sunshine on a spring morning. Jerin had no other words to describe it.

She brought his hand palm-up and Jerin uncurled it as best he could. Nessa touched it with gentle fingers. They were callused. Jerin could feel roughness of her fingers against the back of his hand. She made a sound that was like sucking in air as she turned his hand over and looked at the back. The badly-knitted bones made protruding bumps there as well. She looked up at him, and the light was on her face, now. There were tears in the corners of her eyes.

"You poor thing," she said. Jerin felt a flush prickle his skin.

"Uh... it's... well, you got punished, too," was all he could manage to say. Why was he so out of control of his mouth? "I've thought of that for years. I still sometimes hear your screams." She looked away.

"It wasn't as bad as that," she mumbled. Jerin remembered what her father had said earlier that day. The priest had damaged her back.

"Are you sure about that?" Jerin asked.

"It could have been worse. I still have the use of my hand," she said, still not meeting Jerin's eyes.

"I'm sorry," Jerin said, but that was the wrong thing. A spark of fury shone on her face. She stared into Jerin's s eyes.

"Sorry? You don't need to be sorry. That whoring excused for a priest should be sorry." Jerin sucked in a breath at the language. "Two lives ruined by a little childhood adventure? That is what he should be sorry for." Nessa stepped away from Jerin. Her hands went to the ties a on the front of her blouse. Jerin noticed that she was dressed not much better than he was. Her robe was already loose, but now she was starting to untie the laces on the front of what looked like a nightshirt. Looking down, Jerin realized that Nessa was barefoot. Jerin's mouth went dry, but when the ties were undone, she turned away. In one swift motion, Nessa pulled the shirt and robe off her shoulders, exposing her back. There, in the stark light of the lamp sitting on the reading table, was a series of scars that striped her back in rough, ugly weals.

"See?" she said in a hoarse whisper. It sounded like she was crying. Her shoulders were now shaking slightly. Unbidden, Jerin's good hand reached out and touched the scars. They were as rough to the touch as they looked. Suddenly, Jerin understood what Nessa's father had meant by his comment to the priest. With scars like this, Nessa's prospects for marriage were poor. It was something that you could hide with clothes, but sooner or later scars like this would be discovered. Nessa turned back to Jerin. She held the top of her blouse and robe covering her breasts, but there still was an large expanse of skin exposed.

Jerin knew he was staring but he couldn't help it. He just hoped she could forgive him for it. Nessa shrugged her top back onto her shoulders, then wiped at her eyes.

"Reading books is all that comforts me," she said, indicating the open volume on the table. "You don't know how long I had to plead to father to come to the temple and make that petition today. But I could see that it was no good as soon as he started asking. I'd forgotten just how closed-minded the priests are. Much worse than the run of the mill men in the city."

"Your father almost said too much," said Jerin, remembering how the priest had risen after Malth complained about the state his daughter was left in by the temple's punishment.

"He did," she said with a little smile. "But then I always did ask him for too much." Even though Nessa had put her clothes back together, the ties in the front were still undone, and the way that it both hid and revealed the skin that she had just shown him made Jerin acutely aware that he himself was only wearing minimal clothing. Uncomfortably, he attempted to adjust his posture so that his robe hung more loosely over his front.

"And, uh, you came here tonight..." Jerin tried to distract from his body's embarrassing reaction.

"To prove that I couldn't be stopped." Nessa's voice had a touch of amusement in it. "I wanted to banish the memories that have haunted me for years." She moved closer. "What do you think it means that I met you here tonight?" she asked. Nessa took Jerin's ruined right hand into both of hers.

"Just lucky," was all Jerin could say. She now was right up against Jerin, holding his hand. He couldn't pull back, and there was no way that she could not notice that he was swollen.

"Maybe," she said as she placed a delicate kiss on the knuckles of his hand, "It was a chance for us to banish those memories together." This time she placed a kiss on his palm. Jerin's nerves were on fire. Everything else in the world faded out. He was aware of nothing else except the young woman before him. Nessa lowered his hand from her mouth, and turned her face up towards his. But before Jerin could lower his lips to hers to kiss her, Nessa slipped Jerin's hand inside of her unlaced blouse. Jerin found his injured hand cradling her as-yet hidden left breast. He was so shocked, he couldn't organize his lip muscles as Nessa's lips captured his. It was sensory overload. Soft, firm flesh in his hand, soft, wet lips crushed against his, with a slight grating of teeth and a flash of tongue, and a form pressed up against him, his own member erect and crushed between them. As near as he could remember, he hadn't ever had so much as a hug or a kiss before. A moan escaped his mouth, and he felt a smile tighten Nessa's lips on his. It was then that they both heard voices. They jumped away from each other, straightening clothes.

It was Nessa who reacted first. She cursed and leaped away, blowing out the lantern on the table. The light immediately lowered, but there still were lights in the library. Jerin was already in motion to get to the shelf to climb when Nessa grabbed the book on the table and followed. They moved silently, and Jerin let Nessa go first.

She started the climb and Jerin only waited until she was above him before he started climbing as well. The voices were well within the Library now, and it sounded like they were searching. "They couldn't be looking for me, could they?" thought Jerin. Why on earth would anybody be searching for him, unless someone had seen him leave the dorm and decided to rat him out. Jerin was hit with a sense of deja vu. It was so similar to what had happened to the two of them so many years before, that he could barely stop a hysterical giggle.

Looking up, he remembered something else that had happened so long ago. Again, Nessa was not wearing clothes suitable for climbing, but the folds of cloth were draping around her legs, depriving Jerin of a view of Nessa's rear end. He was just about to reach up for the next shelf with his right hand, when the folds parted, and Jerin was rewarded with a glimpse of skin. She was wearing underpants, but the sight startled him enough that he failed to get a good grip on the shelf. Jerin's fingers slipped from the aged wood, and for a moment, he was dropping. The fingers of his left hand grabbed the shelf below, and his feet skidded onto the shelf he had just hoisted himself from, but with a crack that reverberated in Jerin's ears, it gave way.

He managed to grab the shelf with his right hand alongside his left, but his feet no longer had a purchase and they dangled into space. There was a rumble as the books on the shelf began a slow motion tumble to the floor below. Jerin saw Nessa look back, just as she reached the top of the shelf.

"Go!" he said in a hoarse whisper. Jerin could feel his grip on the shelf slipping. He s tried to swing a leg up to reach the next shelf up, but missed. His fingers could not hold on. He was going to fall. Then Jerin sensed a line of force moving towards him. It was coming upwards, and would pass by fairly close. Would it be close enough? Gritting his teeth, Jerin tried to get his straining ligaments to hold on for a moment longer. Just as he felt he had to scream at the exertion, he threw out his left hand. His injured right hand, unable to maintain the grip, slipped off the shelf and Jerin began his plunge to the solid floor planks below. He was not going to reach the thread. It was moving fast, but even with an outstretched arm, would miss his fingers. He closed his eyes and willed his arm to grow six inches.

He sensed the thread settle against his palm. Reflexively, he closed his fingers, and felt a jerk as the thread arrested his momentum towards the floor. It stretched, but then Jerin found himself rising dangling from his hand closed on nothing. His trajectory was taking him up, but also towards the wall and the alcove which was their exit from the library.

Without thinking about it, he released the thread and landed lightly in the dark alcove before a stunned Nessa. She was still standing on the bookshelf, barely risen to a crouch, watching as Jerin went from falling to flying.

Unfortunately, the energy that had lifted Jerin was released when he let go. Both he and Nessa flinched as there was a resounding crack. There was a cloud of dust and falling debris. Eyes watering and coughing, Jerin looked up to see a dark, star-shaped hole in the roof of the library a long distance above. There were shouts coming nearer and the sound of several pairs of feet running.

It was time to leave. Jerin extended his hand, beckoning to Nessa. Losing her catatonia, she took a step and leaped over the gap to the floor, catching Jerin's hand as she landed. They started running, and didn't stop until they had reached the statue of Levifid. Breathing hard, Nessa pressed her back against the wall of the stone passage and slid down to her haunches. She was staring at Jerin.

"I'll explain some time," said Jerin. She crooked an eyebrow at him as though doubting he could. "I promise." She got up and together they climbed down into the main corridor. At the junction for the laundry room, They stopped briefly. Nessa came close quickly and gave Jerin a peck on the lips. She didn't say anything about what had happened, but for a moment held Jerin's eyes with hers before turning and ducking into the laundry room.

It was only when Jerin started moving and maneuvered down the hall towards the dorm that he realized that just like with Pol he now had one of these connections with Nessa. He laughed when her realized it was coming from his right hand. When he saw Nessa again, he would have to note exactly where on her body it was connected.

Jerin slowed his pace when he returned to the dorm. The lights were out, but that made the empty black opening all the more ominous. Was there someone inside waiting to ambush him as her returned? Jerin stared at the doorway. It was ajar, which was unusual. Normally after lights out, the doors were closed.

He couldn't stand out in the hallway forever. Sooner or later, someone would return and find him either way. He had no choice. Taking a breath, Jerin crept into the darkened room. There was no immediate reaction to it, so he waited until his eyes adjusted to the dark enough to make out the dark shapes of the bunks. He moved as quickly as he could to his own bunk. He ripped off his robe and tossed it up onto his bunk. As he put a foot onto the ladder to climb up, Jerin heard a whisper from the lower bunk.

"Say you were in the lavatory."

Jerin paused for a moment, then climbed up. He crawled under his blanket and waited. The room was not the usual silence of sleeping boys. It had a waiting silence, that was broken occasionally by a whisper that was on the edge of Jerin's hearing, like many of the boys were discussing his entry with their bunk mates.

Soon, lights appeared beyond the dorm door. There were the sound of many feet and a mix of adult and youthful voices. Light flared in the room as a stream of priests and several of the eldest acolytes came in. Two of the boys dashed along the rows of bunks until they reached Jerin's. They raised their lanterns up high, and Jerin looked down at then. Their faces were dirty, he observed idly.

"He is here!" one yelled. It was Hume. What had Pol said? Pretend I'd been in the lavatory.

"Of course I'm here," he muttered, as though being wakened from sleep.

"Bring him," came the firm tone of Q'docet near the door.

"You heard," sneered Hume.

"Me?" Jerin feigned innocence.

"Yes, you." Jerin made a show of grabbing his robe and climbing down. When he got to the floor level, he put his robe on and tied it carefully before following the two boys to where the priests were waiting. Hume and the other boy saluted firmly, as though they had brought a dangerous criminal to justice. Jerin followed suit, but with only a normal level of formality. He was surprised to see that five of the priests were in formals, with the painted faces, including Q'docet. He tried to recognize the others, but the paint made it very difficult to tell.

"Acolyte," you were out of bed after curfew," said Q'docet. "Explain."

"I had to visit the lavatory," Jerin said. He tried not to show nerves, but didn't want to appear too calm before this array of priests. "It was something I ate."

"That is most unfortunate," said the priest. "Are you feeling better now?"

"Yes, Magister," said Jerin, bowing his head. Dust and bits of plaster chose that moment to fall from his fair hair. As he saw it fall, he knew that he was caught.

"We shall have to take a look at the lavatory. It would seem that the roof of our temple is in a terrible state of repair if two sections of it were to fall in in one night." Jerin winced, but kept his eyes down. He didn't want to look at Q'docet. "Or perhaps you could save us the trouble of investigating the lavatory by instead explaining the circumstances and method by which you destroyed part of our library?"

The small group of Junkers pushed through the undergrowth. The broad leaves of the shrubs reached up chest high. To an observer, they might have appeared to be swimming through the green, treading water under the shadows of the trees. The trees themselves were the largest that their leader, Gef, had ever seen. No one had ever gone so far into the Dead Zone before that he had heard of. No one had ever harvested the timber here. It was too dangerous, it was said. It was a death sentence to come into the Dead Zone. He squinted up into the sunlight coming through the branches high above. If it was death, why was everything in here so alive? Everywhere he looked, the planet was crawling with life. He had seen no blemishes on the leaves, and the white tails of deer had disappeared into the foliage three times now. Gef had never seen such good hunting. The trees were fully fifty spans tall, and he doubted that if all of this crew held hands that they could encircle the trunks.

Rik coughed up ahead. The only sick things Gef could see were he and his companions. Not sick, but worn. They were worn, while everything around them was new and vibrant. Rik spat a wad of phlegm into the verdure, then hitched at his pants before starting to swim through the leaves again.

They all wore metal plates covering their torsos. The makeshift vests hung heavy on all of them, brushing their knees. They were a defense against the invisible threat that lay over the Dead Zone. It was said that anyone who came in here was fine for a while, but soon a sickness would overtake them, making them waste away, eventually dying.

Gef looked suspiciously at every rock and branch. He could see nothing that would hurt him. Sure, the insects could sting, and the wild cats would attack a child if they were hungry enough, but there was nothing threatening him that he could see.

Gef wiped sweat from his brow. *This had better pay off,* he thought. He had lived for fifty-three years, scraping a living. He didn't intend for that to end. Grey was the dominant color of himself and those with him. Their clothes, their metal vests and for three of them, their hair. It was a hard life as a Junker. Their pacers and their wagon they had had to abandon only an hour into the Dead Zone. The growth had become too much to pass. Now they were on foot, and with only a vague idea of how far they would have to go. Gef didn't like being on the back foot already on this expedition, and Jen was grumbling. Jen was at the rear of their procession. His wife of thirty years and his business partner, Jen was as grey as he was. She had agreed to came and had understood the risks as well as he did. But Gef hoped that her dissent didn't spread to the others. When they found what they were looking for, he would need all of their strong backs to carry out the riches.

Sam stumbled and disappeared under the leaves, swearing loudly. Gef had to stop and pull his friend's hand, lifting him back to where he could be seen. "Lousy green shit," he cursed as he shifted his metal vest on his shoulders . He carried an axe and a large coil of rope around his shoulder and torso. They were not carrying much with them. They would need a way to carry stuff back out Lwith them.

"You alright, my friend?" asked Gef. Sam replied a smile, showing more gaps than teeth. He was a big man, his shoulders wider than the handle of the axe he was carrying. Sam was the youngest of this crew, hand-picked by Gef for his ability to follow orders and being stronger than a burden beast. Everyone on this crew was hand-picked. Sam for his strength. Rik for his ability to pick locks. Gef didn't  know what they would find in here the Dead Zone, but it was better than even odds that it would be protected by something. Jen inspired loyalty in the others. She had raised Sam and his kin as part of the Junker commune. Bon, the other youth on the crew, too. Bon was athletic, still in the bloom of youth. He wasn't grey. He was here to be able to climb and scale. He had been on the run from the Guardsmen of Arnath for years after they accused him of burgling by climbing in upper-story windows of Victoria. They were right, but Gef trusted Bon. He was a good Junker and his eyes were glowing with the thought that they might see treasures not seen since the lost days.

It was the second day since they had left the pacers behind. Despite the trees, Gef had had no trouble keeping their bearings. The sun had shone through the canopy and the crew had kept moving straight into the center of the Dead Zone.

The old book that Gef had found had led him here. It had taken years to scrounge the right kind of metal for these vests. The dull grey, soft, heavy metal was called lead. It was the waste from the silver mines in the Barrier Range, but even so it had taken years. Gef shifted his own vest. It was starting to rub his skin raw. He didn't understand how the metal was supposed to protect them. It was too soft for armor, but they said that the threat here was invisible and silent. He touched the long knife at his hip, a nervous habit of his. He looked around again, and saw nothing but healthy green. And his crew.

"I think there's a clearing ahead," said Bon. He clambered up onto a fallen tree carcass, raising him up three meters at least. "Yep, I was right." The land was rising here. Gef gave Rik a push to keep moving, but couldn't see much. Maybe there was more daylight up ahead. The maps showed the Dead Zone as being an oblong shape, shorter on the west and longer on the east. The center of the zone was nearer to the eastern side. It was always marked in red on the maps, and usually with a skull, or a weird, three-pointed shape with a circle in the middle. That was where they were headed.

Gef was no fool. He was not here to die. Even the biggest haul of all time wais not worth dying for. But unlike most Junkers, he had done a fair share of living in the towns. The townsfolk liked to write everything down. He had even learned how to read himself. And when the townsfolk wrote things down, sometimes there were things to learn that maybe they didn't even mean to share.

Like stories of the Dead Zone. It stood on the straight line from Storkreach to Victoria. The East Road looped way to the North, right against the Barrier Ranges to avoid it. But sometimes people had gone in. A fisherman on the river who strayed too far, or a messenger trusting to luck and cutting the corner on the Road to get to his destination faster. There were records of their deaths and maps showing where they had gone. And Gef had noticed somethigg: there were deaths in the ancient times from straying only ten klicks south of the Road. But in more recent times, others had dared much more and passed unscathed. It had taken him ten years to convince himself that the Dead Zone was in fact shrinking. And the first to the center would reap the rewards.

No one knew what lay a5 the centre of the Dead Zone, but anything protected by a silent killer had to be worthwhile. By his reckoning, they had to be coming close to the place marked with a skull on the maps.

Again, he searched for any threat, but he saw nothing but green life. Bon jumped down from his vantage point on the tree trunk and forged ahead. "I'm right, it is clearing!" he shouted to those behind him.

"Would somebody smack him?" muttered Rik. "I don't bloody care if it's clearing ahead. It would be like the last six bloody clearings. It just means that this shit is thicker." He pushed aside the bushes, a snarl on his lips.

In one minute, Rik was silenced. The five Junkers stood at the edge of a landscape unlike anything any of them had ever seen. Unconsciously, Jen slipped her hand into Gef's. Rik adjusted his metal vest again. Gef felt a cold in the pit of his belly. There was no life here. The rise they had been slowly climbing for the last few klicks fell away. Before them lay a round depression that was lost in the distance. The floor of the depression was dark and caught the sunlight in an odd way. It looked nearly like a frozen lake, with concentric rings of frozen ripples. No green lived here. It was a flat, barren surface, but what lay in the center was what drew the eye.

"Looks like friggin' glass," muttered Rik. "Like near that volcano. You know the one I mean, Gef?"

"Yeah, I know the one," said Gef. His mouth was dry and it was hard to form the words. There was a volcano up north, beyond the Plenne. It threw fire all year 'round. And there were sheets where the rock had cooled quickly that were black glass. "But that ain't no friggin' volcano." He didn't need to point. There was no doubting what he meant. It wes mind-bendingly large. Gef could see the white specks of birds flying less than halfway to it, and they gave some sense of scale. Giant ribs stood out against the pale skyline, like some giant creature had died and left its corpse to rot in the sun. But these jutted up to what must have been a klick into the sky.

The rest of the corpse made a mountain that the ribs jutted from. Without them, Gef might have thought it *was* a volcano. The sunlight also reflected off this distant mass in a strange way. It was not shiny, but there was a metallic glint from the shadowy bulk.

"What is it?" grunted Sam, scratching his head as he squinted. "We gotta cross that?" he pointed at the frozen plain that filled the distance between them and the distance wreckage.

"Yep," said Jen. She sounded afraid. Gef had never known Jen to show any fear in her life. Gef could almost imagine some invisible threat roaming that alien glass plain, waiting for them to try to cross it. Like a toothfish in the Western Ocean, waiting just under the waves. He gave an uncontrollable shudder. He felt a squeeze from Jen's grasp, and he let her hand go.

"Let's go," he muttered. "We didn't come this far to stand here staring. I want to get there before sundown." He saw Rik shoot a glance at the position of the sun in lie sky and shrug. It would be a tight thing to make it before dark, but at least they wouldn't have to fight through any more of this greenery.

It was an hour past sunset when the five Junkers reached the massive hulk in the centre of the Dead Zone. They were hot and thirsty: the glare of the sun had reflected off of the sometimes shiny surface of the huge depression. They had discovered Rik was right: the ground was a mix of solid and broken volcanic glass. The shards of it would cut better than steel.

"Those Northerners charge for this stuff," pointed out Jen. "Even if we find nothin' else, we can take some of this back."

"We didn't come here for glass," Gef grunted. Even before they reached the main mass, they passed ragged chunks of dull metal and what looked like ceramic the size of houses. There was nothing salvageable or even recognizable in them, but it was undeniable that whatever they were, they were made by people. There were some untouched surfaces and seams the material. It hurried them on.

Now they were in the outskirts of the enormous mountain of wreckage. There were huge voids that they could easily find, caverns that birds came in and roosted for the night. It was frustrating to be here and to have to wait until morning.

"No way to know if you're going to plunge into a hole," pointed out Gef when Bon tried to urge them to light torches and start searching for salvage. The morning did come eventually, and the tiny humans were climbing in and through the eerie ruins as soon as the light permitted. No one had any idea what they were looking at. There was no gleam of gold, and mostly what they found were huge metal beams and sheets hung together like a twisted gossamer frame. Some surfaces were soot black and a little scraping revealed more metal and ceramic underneath. There were some panels that had colorful squares in them, but closer inspection showed that the squares were made of some softer material, not gemstone. Shards of glass were everywhere, the black volcanic mixed with clear.

By the end of the fifth day, their supply of water was growing short. The five Junkers were gathered in the shade of one of the great, arching metal structures. Gef itched with unwashed sweat and longed to pull this stupid lead vest off. But he hadn't removed it for seven days and wouldn't stop now. There wasn't much talk. There were four other long faces. Some interesting things had been discovered, including some massive machinery of some sort. It was like a steam engine, but twenty times taller than a house. And there was a conical section at one end so large that Sam couldn't throw a stone from one side to the other. They were in a confusing mass of huge wrecked things.

"No treasure," grumbled Rik as he massaged a shoulder.

"No," said Gef. He didn't want to say it aloud, but he was an honest man at heart. "We might end up taking, some sacks of tht volcanic glass back after all," he said. He tried to smile as he said it, but he couldn't force his face to do it.

"What do you think it means?" asked Bon, squatting at the edge of the shadow, looking down into the dark recesses of the mountain. "I've seen a lot of things that were made. If it was made, who made it? And for what?" Gef agreed with the boy. He, too had seen a lot of things in the past five days. Surfaces with writing on them that he couldn't read, but the words were embedded right into the material. He couldn't scrape it off. The shapes of the letters were familiar, but he couldn't make them out.

"Looks like a building fell over," said Jen.

Bon scoffed. "No way. Nothing like that. Too big. Not even the old ruins were anything like this. You know, that rusted hill north of Victoria? Imagine that, but a hundred times bigger. A thousand times."

"What, then?" said Jen. She bit her words, in the way that Gef knew she was angry. This time it wasn't about the decision to come here. It was not knowing.

"I dunno. Like a ship." Bon waved his hand at the huge arcs of metal that stretched into the sky. "Like the ribs on a ship. But..." his voice trailed off. Even he couldn't imagine something that big.

"Do you feel that?" asked Sam from where he was lying down.

"Feel what?" asked Jen.

"Shaking. In the ground." He patted the surface below him, Len put his hands out flat, pressing his fingers to it. Gef leaned over from the jagged block that he was sitting on to touch the ground. He wasn't the only one.

"I don't..." Rik began, but he cut off. Gef could feel something. He got down and kneeled with his hands, on the ground. There was a faint vibration there, and it was growing. When he had first touched the ground, he had barely felt something. Now it was distinct. Soon, there was a low, throbbing sound that reached them, coming from everywhere at once. All five pairs of eyes were searching every way for some threat. Gef moved to where he could see outwards from the wreckage towards the glass plain. He could see the distant edge of the forest, marking the end of the depression and the way back to where their pacers were. Something told him that the sound was coming from that direction, but with the towering slabs of metal and ceramic around then, sound would echo in every direction.

"Something we set off?" said Jen quietly at Gef's shoulder. He hadn't heard her come close.

"Can't see how," said Gef. "Nothing alive in there except for birds. Saw a few critters. Nothing to set off an alarm." He was eyeing the trees on the horizon, though. If they needed to leave quickly, it was a long walk over open terrain.

"There!" shouted Bon. He was pointing to the left of where Gef was looking, a few points to the south. There was what looked like a dust devil swirling on the glass, less than a klick from where they were. Everyone crowded to where they could see. Their position was up higher than the plain, giving them a good view. The dust cloud grew. It was not a dust devil, Gef could see. It was like rising dust. It made sense to him: the vibration could cause something like that. He'd seen it in the machine rooms of the ocean-going fishing vessels.

They didn't have long to wait. The throbbing sound reached its peak and the place where the dust was rising collapsed. One moment, the surface was untouched, and then the next there was a hole. It was difficult to tell from this distance, but it looked like enough for a large man to lie down in.

"What do we do?" asked Sam, but Rik put a hand on his shoulder as first one, and then two more figures rose out of the hole. They appeared to rise from the hole easily, and in only a moment all three were standing around the hole, looking in every direction. Ether two of them were very tall or the one figure was very short. A child with two parents, maybe?

Who are they?" asked Rik.

"Popped out of the ground," said Jen. "In the middle of the Dead Zone."

"Do we help them?" asked Sam.

"No, you dumb sonovabitdh," said Rik. "We watch where they go and then to the other way.

"There's only three of them," said Sam defensively. "One's just a kid."

"We stay down," growled Gef. "We don't want any trouble." Five pairs of eyes watched the three figures. The two taller figures were appearing to have a discussion, while the small one was moving about aimlessly. It was supporting the notion that it was two parents and a child.

But then things changed rapidly. Gef saw that one of the tall people was looking in their direction and then the second tall one did the same. Gef was about to raise a warning when something seized him. It was nothing that he could see, but it felt like an enormous hand.

"The invisible killer!" Bon shouted.

"Gef, I'm caught," said Rik. He was looking in Gef's direction. He could not raise his arms and was standing tall and still.

"Me too," said Jen. Her long, grey hair, tied back in a queue, was pressed unnaturally against her. "I can't move."

"Don't panic," Gef managed to say before he was yanked forward. He bit off a scream as he hurtled into the air, flying out from their spot in the shade and into the open. His brain was frozen, but his eyes tried to pick out the place that he would impact the ground. It took a second or two to realize that he was not on a crash course: he was moving straight towards where the three figures stood around their hole in the glass. The others were right there with him. He heard some shouts and curses, but they all had died away before they came to a soft stop only a handspan above the ground, ten meters from the waiting people.

Gef wasn't sure they were people. Two of them, anyways. The short one, he realized, was not particularly short. She was dark of hair and eye, and at least two hands taller than Jen. She was dressed in some sort of dark robe that wrapped around her, and there was a gleam in her eyes. When Gef saw her eyes clearly, he nearly took a step back. Their irises were red, giving her a demonic look. The other two he had to look up at. They were tall, inhumanly so. They were both slight of frame and long-limbed. Their hands and fingers were long, and so were their faces. Both clean-shaven, Gef took them to be male. One was older, or seemed so. There were a few lines on his face and a few white hairs at his temples. The younger was also dark-haired, but showed no signs of lined skin or white hair. There was something melancholy about his expression, Gef thought.

The older of the tall men spoke first. He spoke quickly, and with an irritated manner, but Gef could not understand a word. He looked to Jen and Rik who were beside him, and they each shook their heads.

"I am sorry, but I don't understand you," said Gef. He might have made a friendly gesture, but his arms were stilled pinned to his sides. "My name is Gef. These are my crew. Are you holding us? Please release us. We will do you no harm." *What harm could I do?* he asked himself. *They are holding all five of use without any effort at all.* The younger tall man said something unintelligible to the older one. He showed no emotion when he did it. He almost looked numb. Like he was on ether. The older man showed a flash of anger and said something back and the younger one shrugged.

Levifid shrugged. He did not know how long they had been trapped in Sicaria's cavern. Brief periods of wakefulness in between long sleeps in her cryosleep field left him with no more frame of reference than the older doninus. If he had been a physicist by trade, he might have known what the radioactive elements were from the crash of the *Compass Rose*. Then he might have been able to calculate the half-life of them and know exactly how long it would be until this area was safe enough to cross and exit. But he wasn't a physicist. Melior knew that.

"Long enough for the language to shift a fair amount," Levifid said. "We really should be leaving. Every breath here is adding to our exposure."

"You 're right about that. I just want to know more about what we will find. I don't like not knowing."

"Look at them," said Levifid. "Melior, they are scavengers. Picking over the crash site. Not exactly the people I would go to for information. Let's leave them and be gone."

"No," said Sicaria. The word startled Levifid. In between their long sleeps, Levifid had noticed Sicaria's growing propensity to verbalize, but he was never expecting it when she spoke. She was moving around the bound scavengers, looking each of them up and down. Levifid looked more closely at their prisoners. They were all roughly Caucasian, perhaps with a darker tone of skin than normal. That might have just been a lifetime of exposure to the sun. Three were in their later years. Levifid guessed near to seventy, but corrected himself. These people might not have the medical or nutritional resources that Terrans expected. They were probably at the end of their middle years, anyways. Four men and one woman. All looked like they had little excess fat, but the one man was a brute. He looked like he came from naturally strong stock. Their clothes were rough natural fibers, and if they had been dyed, it had long since been worn out of the cloth. Over top of each person's dress was a vest of what looked like lead plates sewn together over leather.

"They knew enough to protect themselves from the radiation," said Levifid, "but I doubt that those vests will be effective."

"Let's leave them," Melior said with a nod. "We will be able to find a local town shortly, I imagine."

"No," repeated Sicaria. "I want them." Levifid felt a cold feeling in the pit of his stomach. When Sicaria showed interest in someone, the results were never pleasant.

"If we take them, then we will be slowed," objected Levifid. It was his only option to try to preserve the five people.

"They are dying," said Sicaria. It was a simple statement of fact.

## Visions in the Dark

Jerin didn't know if he had passed out and lost his count, or if his mind had rebelled in the dark and insisted that he see something. The unrelieved black of his cell seemed to be awash in a sky-blue. Then there were clouds, and fields of green, all below him as though he was flying. Far below him, Jerin could see the massive square of the walls of Victoria, a dark shape on the land. Somewhere within those walls was the Temple and somewhere in the depths of the Temple he was sitting and hallucinating. He knew this, but it made no difference to his mind.

He had seen enough maps of the lands of Arnath to know where he was, but he marvelled at his mind's ability to fill in details and build such an expansive view for him. Jerin could feel the cold of the wind on his cheeks and the damp cold of a cloud as it briefly enveloped him. Of its own accord, the picture shifted to the East, across the hundreds of clicks or rolling grass with trees lining the waterways and extending south from the mountains to the north. The hills of the Escarpment passed beneath him. The quiet lands of the Dead Zone passed. He didn't know what lay in there, but his mind drew forests and life under a soft, glowing light that seemed to come up from the ground. The Dead Zone gave away to lands were people lived. The sway of Victoria was less here. Each place had its Temple. The missionary priests of the order preached the Words and kept the towns and villages in line with Melior's teachings Jerin only knew some of the names of the villages in the East, but one above all else was on his mind. Even before he could say the name silently in his head, his point of view swept north and into the foothills of the Barrier Range. Bent Forthouse, or the remains of it, sat quiet and desolate in its namesake valley.

It was a place that Jerin did not know at all, depsite it being the place of his birth. Who knew how many generations of his ancestors had lived here, surviving through the Apocalypse and then the days of chaos that followed. All to come to an end when the Lord's Guardsmen had marched through the unguarded gates and slaughtered everyone. Everyone except him.

Jerin looked down at the Bent Valley, with the forthouse at the top end with a wall and a keep and knew it to be completely fabricated by his mind, but he could not help but want to see it for real. Maybe someone still lived there. Maybe he had not been the only survivor. Jerin felt the stone walls of his cell pressing in on him, despite the intensity of his hallucination. He could not be free. He would not get to see this place. He couldn't even say for certain that he would leave his cell again. This might be the end of the line for him in an institution that never wanted him in the first place.

"I don't want him in this Temple or in the Order!" shouted Q'docet, his face going purple with the strain to keep from crossing the room and striking the old fool. Tulan F'horus, the ignored and forgotten black sheep of the Order, who should have kept to his rooftop lodgings, was appealing to the head of the Order and succeeding. Rastus, the imposing figure of a priest, the man who had been commanding the Guards on that day when Jerin N'patri had been found, was listening the to the fool with sympathetic eyes. "You have put him in my guardianship for a decade and a half, Highest," Q'docet continued, trying to control himself. "If anyone should be a judge of the boy's worth, it should be me. He has shown nothing but weakness for all that time, never excelling, never becoming a part of the Order. He was never meant to be a part of the Order and should not become a priest. Under any circumstances." He ran out of breath. He couldn't say it any plainer than that.

"Yes, you would be the best judge, if you were an unbiased observer," said Tulan. His robe was a disgrace, with stains of earth on the cuffs and hem and a smudge even on the bowl and sphere sigil on the breast. The symbol was nearly covered by his ridiculous beard, fanning grey over his chest. He was another one who did not belong in the Order. "But if you take away the hatred, you will see a boy who has fought to endure even with the rest of the Order and even his supposed guardian working against him." Q'docet opened his mouth to retort, but Tulan raised a finger and to Q'docet's shame he fell silent. "Jerin is a boy who blossomed in only a few months with me and out of the poisonous atmosphere of his Rank. A boy with one working hand due to the cruelty of that guardian..."

"His punishment was just!" yelled Q'docet. He saw a disapproving look on the Highest's face, but Q'docet knew he was right. "The crime was severe and so was the punishment. That was never in question!"

"There is a difference between being severe and being cruel." Tulan's voice was not raised. His dark eyes, which so often seemed vapid and empty of thought to Q'docet were focused like a hawks. "Despite the cruelty and the crippling of his dominant hand, he has continued to perform admirably. Even his weapons and unarmed combat instructor says so." He nodded in the direction of the man. Captain Decco was standing silently against the wall of the chamber, arms the size of most men's legs crossed over his barrel chest. He remained silent but did not refute the bearded priest's assertion.

"Admirably? Did you not see the disgraceful behavior in the mess? He attacked the smallest boy in his Rank and then did not have the fortitude to see it through. Oh, of course you did not. You were elbows deep in fertilizer at the time." Q'docet tried to put all of his derision for this old idiot into his voice. "You have no idea what happens in the Temple, Tulan. You cannot understand what an embarrassment the boy is. And has been for his entire time here. He should be put out of the Temple as soon as he is released. Let him show the rest of Arnath what an asset he is."

The Governing Council of the Order was meeting in the official chambers and both Q'docet and F'horus had been called to testify on the matter of the failed raising of Jerin N'patri to the priesthood. One of the scholars had taken the time to review the records and found that such a thing had never been recorded in the Temple, ever. Normally, this meeting would have been held to hand the new priest his first assignment. Now, it was an opportunity for Q'docet to right a wrong that had almost happened. He still didn't know who had made the decision to raise Jerin. Such decisions were normally the made with the acolyte's teaching priest, but Q'docet had heard of it when the summons had come to attend the raising in the Hallows of the Temple.

"The boy that he attacked was not just 'the smallest boy' of the Rank, was he?" asked Tulan. He did not wait for an answer. "He was Pol, the only boy of the Order who had ever befriended Jerin. And every friendship has its ups and downs. I do not know the nature of the disagreement, but to judge based on one outburst in sixteen years seems irrational. As it happens, I have spoken to the boy, Pol. Have you?" Again, Tulan didn't wait for an answer. Q'docet would not have had one. *Who has time to talk to one acolyte?* "It seems that there was some disagreement between them, and Pol admitted that it was his fault. Even the boy that Jerin wronged is standing up for him in this matter."

Jerin's mind showed him his own face. He was older, maybe thrity. He had a beard. Light-colored, of course. Even in his own mind, he couldn't escape his difference. He was dressed as a priest and a fervor burned in his eyes. He was screaming the Words at a cowering group of villagers, all on their knees before him, pressing their foreheads to the dirt as they absorbed his wrath. The older Jerin ranted and paced, gesticulating with his arms when his words were not enough to contain his diatribe. One of the villagers, an older man, was jerked to his tiptoes by unseen forces. To those watching, there was nothing holding the man up, but Jerin could see. He was in control of these unseen forces at least in a rough way, and it was more than enough for these simple peasants. To them, it was magic: the might of Melior made real for them.

With a gripping gesture of his hand, the older Jerin made the net of fibers he had made crush the villager's neck. The man went limp, and Jerin tossed the corpse aside. Jerin watched this with horror. In his own older face, he saw none of what he would recognize as himself. He saw the authority of the Order and the cruelty of Q'docet. There was no pity, no compassion for those that he should be serving. There was no measured understanding of the plight of the village and that they did not meant to cause offense to the Order. To this older Jerin, there was only the sin and the punishment. And he was in control of power that made his authority as judge and executioner absolute. The Words of Melior valued strength above all else. Strength and devotion to Melior and if weakness was found, it should be destroyed. This version of Jerin had taken that to heart.

In his cell in the dark, Jerin whimpered that there was no way that he could do any such thing. "I don't want to be a priest," he muttered over and over. This was not the most distrubing of the visions that plagued Jerin as he tried to survive the dark. Blood and fire. Fear and anger. Never answers, only his deepest fears coming to visit him and show him that he had no idea why he was where he was, who he was or who he was supposed to be.

"What cannot be denied is that in this case, Jerin N'Patri did break curfew and as a result was not available when called upon for raising." The Highest had called an end to the back-and-forth between Q'docet and F'horus. No one else had been willing to step in to take either side. The yellow-haired acolyte was not worth it to them. The Keeper of the Records had objected when Q'docet had started reciting chapter and verse of Jerin's life in the Temple, documenting every infraction he had committed. "Even if it were not already in the Record every time each acolyte was disciplined, I beg that we not recount every episode here," the creaky voice of the Keeper of the Records had whined.

"You are correct," Rastus had agreed. Q'docet's litany had been cut off. "Jerin N'patri has suffered yet another laspe in judgement and this time has been punished for it. However, this punishment will not stand as the black mark that ends his time in the Order as you wish it, brother," Q'docet ground his teeth but said nothing. "He will, however, be retracted from the roll. His raising will be postponed for a future day that might never come, but it will be postponed. It might be that this is only an obstacle and one that he will overcome in time. Or it might be more profound than that. But I have spoken, and that is final." The bass rumble of his voice took a second to die down in the chambers, and all that could be heard was the scratching of the pen nib of the Keeper of the Records. The bastard Tulan gave the Highest a deep and respectful bow. Q'docet felt compelled to do the same, even if he felt that the man had erred deeply.

"Now on to new business," said Rastus. "The witnesses for N'patri may withdraw." Both Tulan and Q'docet gave another bow and then turned to the exit. Tulan let Q'docet precede him out of the chamber and Q'docet left the room with a straight back. "We still have a train heading to the Northern Reaches leaving within the week. We need a raised priest for the mission, and we do not have the one that we expected. Do we have an official recommendation on a resplacement?" The door closed behind Q'docet and Tulan, cutting off the rest of the discussion from the Council. There were no acolytes from his Rank that would be raised, at least that we he was aware of. He hadn't known about N'patri.

"If you feel so strongly about the boy," said Tulan, "I would be pleased to take over his guardianship,"

"He is my responsibility," replied Q'docet in a voice that he hoped was low and threatening. "The future of the Order is in the hands of the teachers, F'horus. That is always my first concern. Not one acolyte is more important than that. And if there is an acolyte that I don't think is worthy of the Order, I will fight just as hard to keep them out."

"Worthy? A choir is made of many voices, brother. The Order needs more than just strength. Sometimes other voices need to be heard too."

"Like yours?" Q'docet sneered. "Go tend your pots and plants. Leave the Order to those who have its best interests at heart." Q'docet turned his back on the older priest. He took two steps before Tulan spoke.

"The Order has to change, brother." He said it quietly. It was not an aside, something that he was not meant to hear. Neither was it a retort, mant to extend their disagreement. It caught Q'docet unawares. "There is more to the world than Anrath, and that world is growing and changing. We will not survive if we stand still."

"The Order has flourished for unknown centuries, old man."

"And all things come to an end. Eventually the wise understand that." Q'docet turned to face Tulan, but was surprised to see the last glimpse of the other priest's robe disappearing around the corner, heading to the stairs up towards his usual rooftop haunts. He did not want to chase the old man. There was no point in arguing with a fool. The only way to win was to not play. He needed to get Jerin out of the cells, anyways.

Levifid wanted nothing more than to be gone to a village. As near as he could figure, it had been millenia since he had been in a bed and enjoyed a hot bath. Some food from the stores that the Junkers had had with them had been more than welcome. The sight and smell of food, no matter how simple, had almost made him faint. Sicaria's static time field did well to allow the centuries to pass, but there were limits. Domini were flesh and blood, and stopping time's passage was not a perfect science. The hardest part had been accurately determining when it was safe to emerge. So long ago, Levifid had been there in the cavern deep underground when the colony ship had crash-landed directly on Settlement. He had been anticipating being killed in the event, along with Melior and Sicaria. That would have been a perfectly acceptable way to end his existence. If he could have played that part in ridding the planet of the pair, he would have gone to his grave satisfied. He would be unmourned and likely forgotten, but that was as it should be.

It had not worked out that way. The cavern that Sicaria had prepared for her most secret experiments had been deep enough in the bedrock to avoid the fire and most of the shock of the two-kilometer-long spacecraft landing on it. Once the impact had finished throwing the three domini around in the underground space, avoiding collapsing rock had been the most pressing thing. But after that, it was clear that radiation from the ship's engines would be their biggest problem.

The cataclysm had sealed the Trinity below ground, but that alone would not have been enough to contain them. Even the weakest of them, Sicaria, had been able to tunnel to these depths in the first place. Tunneling up and out was not the problem. It was the radiated wasteland above that stopped them. They had no way of knowing how far it extended and in what directions. The level of radiation in the first days would have been instantly lethal. Levifid had tried to talk them into tunneling up and out and evacuating as quickly as possible. He had not relished the idea of dying from radiation poisoning, but it would be another chance to eliminate the others.

Melior had called him rash. To the older dominus, time was on his side. To rush back to the surface and potentailly absorb even a hazardous amout of radiation was unacceptable. That had started the long, dark centuries of waiting. A couple hundred years of dreamless non-existence with periodic awakenings had transported the Trinity through time to the present day. *Whenever that is.*

Idly, Levifid thought of the people he had known, both in his life back on Earth in Chicago and here on Tero in the years between Landing and the crash. They were all gone now, perhaps their distant descendants populating Tero. Levifid had the large intellect typical of all domini, but even he had trouble compressing the scale of the elapsed centuries or millenia into his mind. He greatest wish was that the colony was strong and had left the primitive early culture of the settlement behind. Something that could resist the return of the Trinity. But the state of these Junkers and their evident weak grasp of the threat of the radiated crash site did not give Levifid much hope.

Their language drift was further evidence to him that perhaps printing and literacy were not as prevalent as he would like. Language in the presence of the printed word still changes and grows, but not as fundamentally as these Junkers were exhibiting. The Junkers were standing uneasily, shifting and not willing to turn away from the Trinity. They had continued to speak softly among themselves, but not daring to speak up. When they had first returned to this place where their horses and wagon were, Levifid had gotten the one word from them: "Junkers" was how they called themselves. He had been listening intently without showing it and slowing building up a statistical model of the words they used and how their grammar was structured.

Sicaria was off to the side, beside the small fire that they had lit. She was squatting and humming softly to hearself. Levifid did not recognize the melody. Perhaps if he could have, it would give him a clue about her mental state. He had never heard Sicraria have anything to do with music since her fateful day in the Genedyne labs. While Levifid did not feel any different for the passage of so much time in stasis, evidently Sicaria had had a much different experience. The sooner they were away and settled somewhere, the sooner he could start studying her in earnest.

"What do you suppose she wants with them?" he asked. Melior swallowed the last of the dried meat the Junkers had provided before answering.

"The same thing as always. She wants to create something."

"The same as the Order?" asked Levifid. Melior shrugged.

"I don't know. I'd bet against it, though. She has never repeated herself that I know of, and she's changed."

"You noticed?" asked Levifid. Of course he had. If there was one area that Melior always outstripped the younger dominus, it was in perceptivity. His grasp of human connections and behavior made Levifid's own seem obtuse and awkward at best.

"Yes. I can't say that I understand it. She should have had the same experience of time that we did, and yet she has changed while we have not. She has not aged noticeably, that much seems clear. I will be interested in seeing what the extent of the change is." Without warning, Melior rose and walked to face the waiting Junkers. The oldest man was the evident leader of the group, although the other older man definitely held some sway over the younger ones. Levifid wondered what their story was. He might never know, if what Sicaria said was true. They had absorbed too much radiation in the wreckage. Probably had gone right up to the remains of the engines. Their primitive shielding would not have protected them.

"I am Melior," the dominus said. He spoke slowly, watching for any reaction. He got one. Instantly, the color drained out of all five faces. There were a few seconds as their minds processed what he had said, but the reaction to Melior's name was unequivocal. Almost as one, the Junkers dropped to their knees and bowed in a fearful pose.

"Well, it appears as though I have not been forgotten," said Melior, obviously pleased. "I wish I could tell them more." he mused.

"Try this," said Levifid. He rose and stood beside Melior, leaning in to speak into his ear. It was a rough guess from what he had heard, but it was worth a try. Melior listened to the sounds and then spoke them so that the five could hear. *I have returned and you are the first to receive me.* They were suitable for the first words from a long-departed deity. Briefly, Levifid considered putting sacrilegious words into Melior's mouth. It would be amusing, but it would not take the older dominus long to understand that he was being made a fool of. Levifid would be censured for certain and it would not be pleasant. The problem was, Melior would not be above eliminating the Junkers to stop remove any witnesses of his embarrassment. Levifid didn't want that on his concience.

"We need to learn the common language as soon as possible," said Melior. "I can't appear fallible to these people. I want my return to inspire, not cause confusion."

"Shouldn't take too long," said Levifid.

At that moment, Sicaria rose from her position and came over to where the Junkers were kneeling. She went to the largest of the men and he was jerked to his feet by forces that he could not see but could definitely feel. He shouted something that Levifid didn't grasp and despite their fear, the other Junkers raised their heads and began to speak in a jumble of angry words and pleas. Sicaria ignored the outbursts, focusing on the one she had raised.

Levifid watched in despair as Sicaria started to work changes on the man. Levifid had never been the most adept at either the finer or more creative wielding of dark fibers, nor had he been the strongest. Sicaria was an unknown, sometimes showing ignorance and other times flashes of genius and subtlety that made her hard to predict. This was evidently one of the latter times. The big man was surrounded by a thicket of fibers that Sicaria seemed to weave together in a complexity that Levifid could not follow. It was some consolation that he knew Melior would also not understand, but he didn't like these exhibits of competence from Sicaria. It was evidence that the latent invader in her mind, the long-deceased Dictatrix Sicaria, was alive and well.

Levifid tried to watch the invisible work that Sicaria was performing, but soon gave up and just watched the effect it was having. The man was held tightly as Sicaria worked, but his screams were unfettered. The other four Junkers were calling out to their companion. Evidently his name was Sam. The man was changing. His skeleton was being reinforced, as were his sinews. In a way, it reminded Levifid of the work that Dominus Reas had done so long ago to reinforce the walls of his fortress. Levifid understood that the walls had been impervious to the best that the Order had tried to do with dark fibers, which was no mean feat. A dominus could lay waste to thousands of square kilometers when unleashed. That they could not knock down his walls had been an accomplishment worthy of respect. Perhaps Sicaria had taken that lesson and internalized it, because she was doing something similar to this man.

It did not take long, and the man had passed out before she was finished. His face and arms were changed: extremely vascular, giving him a horrific visage. The voices of the rest of the Junkers were calling to their unconscious friend. Sicaria gave a toothy grin and a satisfied nod and then proceeded to the next waiting person.

## A Half-Life

After Jerin was released from his cell, he had trouble readjusting to his life as an acolyte. He had never fit in, but now it seemed that every part of his life did not fit any longer. He took the news that he was not going to be raised to the priesthood with ambivalence. If the priest who had come to release him was surprised by Jerin's lack of reaction, Jerin didn't notice. Time in the cell was always mentally exhausting, but something had snapped inside him this time.

He looked at the faces, with his eyes watering from the sudden light, and could not summon the strength to care. In each face, he could see an echo of the hallucination he had suffered in the dark. Seeing himself as a force of hate and intolerance was not something that Jerin could swallow. He looked at the priests. They were the ones who had robbed him of a family and a life. They had only barely tolerated him for his seventeen years. Who were they to him? Were they his family? Or were they murderers who had ended what life he should have had?

Jerin had always felt a deep need to carry on. To keep going even when his life was hard. If he worked hard enough, surely these others who sat in judgement of him would eventually approve. Their approval had been worth pursuing. He really had never had any other goal.

Now he had faced what his future might actually end up being, and it repelled him.

*If my future is not in the Order, then what do I care whether or not the priests approve of me?* That they had been willing to raise him to the priesthood and then took it away again did not cause him any grief or anger. If anything, what Jerin felt might have been relief.

Tired and half-blind, Jerin floated along between the two priests who were escorting him back to the dormitory. Vaguely, Jerin realized that the one on his left was Q'docet. The looks that his teacher was shooting him might have seemed threatening to Jerin at one point, but he couldn't summon any anxiety. The stone walls of the Temple scrolled by, occasionally decorated by a hanging or a statue in a niche. The patterns of the smooth tiles of the floor were the only thing that Jerin really paid any attention to. He'd never noticed how many different patterns of tiles there were in the different parts of the Temple before.

He was permitted to bathe and make himself presentable before he was required to rejoin his Rank. They were presently in the Third Study, studying the Words. He had to ask what day it was. He had been in the cell for only one day. If Jerin recalled correctly, today was the day that each of the boys in the Rank would have to give an oration on one of the passages of the Words. He found he could recall what he was meaning to present. He had not had a chance to practice, but it would have to do.

The warmth of the bath water brought him to his senses. He started to feel more like himself, and yet he knew that he couldn't look at things in the same way. He dressed, his underlayer of white cotton and then his acolyte robe. He grinned as he tied the sash. It might have been a priest's robes if things had gone differently. He might not have actually been raised, but he was closer than any of the others had been. Jerin grabbed his books and left the dormitory at a brisk walk. There was no sense in running. He was going to arrive in the middle of the class no matter what.

The Third Study was a small theater, with steeply rising benches circling around a small stage with a lectern. There were small windows high up above the top row of benches and the light from them shone down onto the oration area. The closeness of the audience to the presenter made for a very intimate environment. Jerin liked the Third Study. Maybe not as much as the Library, but it was a place that he liked in the Temple.

Jerin pushed open the door as quietly as he could. He could hear a stuttering voice speaking in the room. But even so, his entrance caused the speaker to stop and every eye was on Jerin as he stepped through the door. He was next to the stage. He looked up at the faces in the bench area, unconsciously looking for Pol. That reminded Jerin of the harsh words that they had had for each other, and he felt himself color.

Not waiting to be acknowledged, Jerin bowed and climbed up the steps along the left wall of the theater. At the second to last row, he saw Pol. There was a seat free next to him. Under any other circumstances, Jerin would have sat down immediately next to his friend. But he felt awkward, and didn't want to look the smaller boy in the eye. Jerin's gaze roved over the next-higher and next-lower benches, but they were full.

He sat down next to his friend. He made a noncommittal sort of grunt as a greeting before opening his copy of the Words. The speaker on the stage had started their stuttering speech again. Jerin recognized the boy. He was from the next-older Rank. His skin was pocked with a terrible rash of acne, and his hair hung limply over his face as he looked down at his notes. *Byron, that's his name,* Jerin thought. He was talking about the twenty-third passage. Jerin automatically flipped to that page and scanned it before listening to what Byron was saying.

"And Melior… um, he gave gifts to the Order. Um, the Order were lifted up, like above normal men. Like men who weren't in the Order. They were made in his likeness. I think… I think that this is a meta—metaphor. The Order, while still men, are raised and expected to be like held to a higher standard. To lead, to show the way. That is what the twenty-third passage says to us." The boy finally made eye contact with the audience as he finished. There was a respectful silence from the audience. It was made up of three different Ranks, Jerin saw now. He hadn't remembered that this presentation would be to a large group. He was going to mutter that quietly to Pol, when he remembered that Pol wouldn't want to speak to him.

"Cells again?" Pol whispered. It was so soft that it was barely audible to Jerin. Jerin jumped with surprise, then nodded. "Sorry, Jer. That's tough."

Jerin was surprised by the flood of emotion in him.

"Yeah." It wasn't much. It didn't nearly sum up what the experience was like. But it had to be enough.

Byron was taking a few questions from the crowd.

"What if the gifts were actually gifts and not meta… things. Metaphors," one of the acolytes asked. Byron looked uncertainly in the direction of Q'sammal, his Rank's teacher. When Q'sammal made no motion to intercede with the question, Byron tried answering.

"Well… you know, if there had been real actual gifts, then, like we would have them, right? The Order has been here in Victoria since the Apocalypse. Since Melior rose up and promised to return. If it wasn't a metaphor, then where are the gifts?" Byron gave a crooked smile, proud of his answer. The questioner nodded.

Jerin considered the question. He knew the twenty-third passage well, but he had never thought about it literally. If he'd been raised, then he might have known what the rite of passage was from acolyte to priest. He knew that the acolytes were taken to that room beyond the Hallows where the actual bowl and sphere lay. It made him wonder what happened to the acolytes who went in. For a moment, he wondered if they all started to hallucinate about strange presences in the room and connections between themselves and others that they couldn't explain. *Would that be considered a gift? The ability to launch eggs off the Temple roof that nearly cleared the wall surrounding Victoria?*

Jerin's chuckle was cut short as his name was called out. Byron had left the stage and Q'docet had called on him. Jerin looked at his teacher's face and was shocked by the petty malice there. Jerin and all of the other acolytes had naturally feared Q'docet. They had always looked up to him and deferred to him in everything while fearing his judgement. But for some reason, this young man was looking into his teacher's face and seeing smallness, not greatness.

Quickly, Jerin pulled his scrap of paper out of his book and stood. He put his copy of the Words down on the bench where he had been sitting and made his way back down the steps from the benches to the stage. There were murmurs in the assembled acolytes. *As well there might be,* he thought. *I might have been a priest today if things had worked out differently.* He didn't know how much was known about why he had been put in the cells, but the murmurs had a tinge of respect in them to Jerin's ear. Almost everyone in the room knew firsthand what the cells were like.

Jerin gave a short bow to Q'docet before looking up at the audience. The steepness of the rows of benches made it almost feel like it was a wall of faces and white robes looking down at him. For a moment, he felt nerves, but then Jerin picked out Pol's face and saw the familiar impish grin on his face. There was a small burst of gratitude in the core of him. Even with everything upside down, Pol was still his friend. And that was worth something. Jerin checked his notes and then crumpled them and started speaking.

"The forty-second passage," he said. His voice projected into the perfect acoustics of the room. "The last, and the foretelling of the return of Melior." This was not the sermon that he had prepared. No one ever covered the forty-second passage. To the priests it was a reminder that they were only keeping a fire lit for something that might not happen in their lifetime. But it was also uncomfortable because of its many inconsistencies with the records. After his experience, it seemed like a good time to cover it.

"The forty-second passage. *Lo, I am He that is and shall ever be. Though I might not be with you at present I will never be far away. I am the land and the land is Me. Like the land, I am eternal. Your fathers knew Me, and your children shall know Me. Their children shall know Me and their children. We are new to this land, but it shall never be without Me. The eons shall pass and always I will be there, watching and guiding you into the future.*"

"*I may be absent in time, but the Order is my hand on the reins when I am not among you.*"

The village appeared out of the night. Only a few dim lights gave it any shape to the three domini and five… *others…* who flew through the dark. The Junkers had had a hand-drawn map, and this flyspeck had been the closest thing marked on it. The lights seemed to be coming from a few lamps spilling light out into the night through open windows. The light was orange and welcoming, but Levifid couldn't help but be shocked at the low level of sophistication that these humble lodgings had. When they had been imprisoned, Settlement might have been at a low point, but it still had electricity and windows had glass in them. Not these rude huts. All were single-room, and the livestock and the homes were intermingled. Based on his recollection of European history, Levifid judged this to be something like a pre-industrial revolution farmer's cot. There was a central well, but no proper roads. No vehicles other than a pair of large-wheeled carts were visible in the dark.

"I thought we would come back to better than this," Levifid heard Melior growl to no one in particular.

"It appears that the standard of living in the Yellow Zone is not what it once was," Levifid said. He kept all emotion and judgement from his tone. He did not want to aggravate the older dominus. When he was upset, bad things happened.

"I would kill to find a calendar. Something that told me how much time has passed," said Melior. As they stood in the dim light of the village's main open area, Levifid shook his head.

"You won't find it here." Levifid doubted that there was a single book in the village, let alone a historical record. There were soft sounds of life coming from the huts and the odd noise from the rough stable. A few sheep raised their heads in their pen to inspect the strangers who had dropped out of the sky. They were spooked, as they should be. Sicaria's changes to the five Junkers unnerved him as well.

"You are right. What was the next spot on that map?"

"It's marked as 'Three Rivers'. Would have been near the northwest boundary of the Yellow Zone… back then."

"Then let's get moving. I wouldn't want to stay here. Get some sort of an infestation just lying down here," said Melior. "You grab the Crawler, okay?" The dominus didn't wait for a response. He summoned a set of fibers to grab Sam and the one that looked snakelike and rose into the sky, heading northwest. That left Levifid with the others, and Sicaria.

The Shade he saw rise of her own accord and follow Melior. Sicaria had not given any names to the Junkers that she had warped, but Levifid found himself naming them just to try to file them somewhere in his intellect that made sense. Shade had been the woman in the group. She was not identifiable as such any more. She was no longer easy to see, with a dark, vague outline. The skeletal one with the flowing, smoky wrap he thought of as Death, from the ancient biblical depictions back on Terra. Death could fly of its own as well. Sicaria had seen fit to make those ones with some control over the threads that made them. But the Crawler could not. He stood there, watching Levifid, waiting to be hauled skyward and away from the village.

There was an uncomforable pause. Levifid told himself that it was only because he didn't know exactly where to lift such a strange creature. But his skin crawled when he looked at what Sicaria had done to this man. Where the Junker had had two legs, he now had four. They splayed from his pelvis in two pairs of two, but radiating to make an insect-like stance. His genitals were visible between and underneath the first pair of legs, and Levifid assumed that the other plumbing was down there somewhere as well. A mostly human torso rose from this strange arrangement of lower limbs. Levifid was reminded of a centaur, except that the bottom half was more arachnid than equine. Each of the four legs came to a hardened point, instead of a foot. The process for this one had been the worst. When Sicaria had inflicted this on the Junker, there had been snapping and re-knitting of bones, all while the man screamed.

Back in Settlement, Sicaria had placed illusions on the servants in Trinity Hall, and while there were elements of illusion in each transformation she had done on these poor souls, these were physical transformations also. Levifid would not be able to undo these changes simply by removing an effect. This was permanent. She had managed to make changes within the brains and genes of the Order through the use of her Artifact, and now she was able to create massive changes in the human form through brute force. And yet there was a subtlety to it that shocked Levifid. The human body was not modeling clay that could be re-sculpted into a new form. There were blood vessels, muscles, nerves and skin to break and rebuild. There was no evidende that this transformed Junker would suffer from any nerve damage or circulatory problems. She had made five monsters.

In a way, the first one had been the most straightforward. Sam, the large young man, was now a superhuman. His physical strength and resilience was multiplyed. He was horrific to look at, but Levifid doubted that any five men would be able to put him down. Levifid thought of that one as the Punisher. The others were the Shade, Death, the Serpent and the Crawler. Each one was as different from the others as could be. Each was a tour de force in dark fiber bioscience and it disturbed Levifid greatly.

He picked the Crawler up and lifted him and himself into the sky after the departed Melior and Sicaria and the others. There were two of Tero's moons in the sky tonight. They did not shine as brightly as the Moon on Earth, but it was enough to see the distant shapes of the others, flying through the night. He could not see all of the others, he corrected himself. The Shade was difficult enough to see in daylight. In the night, she was invisible for all intents and purposes. It was unnerving to look at the Shade, knowing that there was a human form there. but blurred and dim. It was an effective cloaking weave. If such a thing had been invented on Earth, it would be a sensation. Many of the things that Sicara had invented were incredible and unprecedented in the history of the domini. That Sicaria should not have had any experience to draw on made it all the more disturbing.

Sicaria was not the original version of herself. Millenia ago, there had been a third-generation dictatrix with that name. She had been a cold and calculating one. A geneticist by training, she had been on the cusp of discovering how to transfer the consciousness of one person into the brain of another. Destroying the mind of the person being invaded, of course. There had been another woman, a human woman, named Thera Chen. This woman, of a disadvantaged background, had fallen into his world and paid for it. In his arrogance and passion, Levifid had believed the promises of the original Sicaria. That she could perform some of the dominus transformations to Thera, giving her some of the capabilities of the superhumans who dictated the affairs of humans on Earth. In doing so, Levifid would have a partner who had the sensitivity and friendship that Thera had shown him, as well as the intellect and dark fiber skills of a dominus.

There were still nights that Levifid lay awake and imagined what Thera might have been like if they had not been betrayed by Sicaria. Of course, they would both be long dead by now, decomposed on a distant Earth. but only after what might have been a long and rich life together. But Sicaria had betrayed them, using Thera as a final test subject of her transference procedure. Levifid had become wise to the fact only once Sicaria had done too much damage. Thera had been overwritten by the time the Peace Corps had entered and provided enough of a distraction that Levifid could kill Sicaria and stop the process.

The half-destroyed Thera had been shipped out with the colony, in the vain hope that the cold sleep mental reconstruction techniques would rehabilitate her before she was awakened. That hope had been in vain. Thera had shown few signs of her old self, and many more of the dark id of the long-dead Sicaria. The new Sicaria was a creature of passion and anger, but also showed slashes of brilliance. There was no denying that the original Sicaria was brilliant, no matter her inhuman disregard of her victims. Both he and Melior had been waiting for a clear ego to emerge from the dark creature that was the damaged Thera. Mielior had been hoping that the old Sicaria would finally fully emerge and be a partner to him. Levifid, on the other hand, had been hoping that Thera would be the victor. He had seen only a few indications that her essential self was still inside her, and they had been his only lifeline on Tero. But now, the radical work that Sicaria had done to these five poor souls was the strongest evidence yet that it was Sicaria who was winning the battle inside Thera's skull.

Idly, Levifid wondered if the Order still existed. They were the original allies for Melior, crafted by Sicaria to do his bidding faithfully. Melior had hoped that he was laying down a faith and authority structure that would last forever. But then Dominus Reas had managed to bring the *Compass Rose* down on their heads. *Did his plans work out? Or had they fallen short without having enough time to mature?* He flew through the night, wrapped in his own thoughts.

There was almost complete silence in the Third Study. The faces of the other acolytes in the benches showed disbelief. Whether it was because of what Jerin was saying or that he had the audacity to say it, he couldn't know.

"That there is no credible record of the presence of Melior since the Apocalypse and the days of chaos, it certainly indicates that whatever the intent was, the events of the Apocalypse changed history. The Order has preserved the legacy of Melior, but without additional guidance from Melior himself, it is impossible to say what the ultimate goal of the Order should be." His voice's echoes died immediately. There was silence, but it was not the respectful silence that Byron had received. It was a stunned silence. No one ever covered the forty-second passage. And certainly no one had ever said these things within the walls of the Teaple. The only face that was not disbelieving was Pol's. Jerin could see a huge grin on his friend's face. If there was one person in the Order who would appreciate the audacity of what he had just said, it was Pol.

Q'docet's face was purple. He looked to be choking. Maybe he was. If he was, Jerin wished he'd done this years sooner. Some part of Jerin knew he was in trouble. Maybe he'd get strapped. Maybe he would be back in the cells. He just couldn't summon the will to care. He felt liberated. He was above the pain. He was above needing Q'docet's approval. Jerin thought of the cruel look on his older face in the hallucination. He would never be that person. There was no way that he would ever let himself be. He had a friend. He had one working hand. He had enough.

## The Second Coming

	"location": "Victoria, Temple, Roof",
	"pov": "Jerin",
	"status": "Rough"
}
-->


It was a long time before Q'docet allowed Jerin to rejoin his Rank. Jerin was not put back in the cells, but weeks of stappings and bread and water and special prayers that lasted for hours on end filled Jerin's days and nights. Every punishment given to an acolyte was supposed to be entered into the Record, but Q'docet made a point of telling Jerin that he would do no such thing.

Jerin suffered in silence, never complaining and never pleading that it stop. The strange detachment that he felt did not leave him. The bruises from the beatings kept him awake at night, unable to find a comfortable position on his thin mattress. The prayers said in penance were unending and psychologically exhausting. He would find himself drifting. half asleep but still speaking the Words by rote. Jerin's lack of repentance infuriated Q'docet. Jerin was not deliberately goading the priest, but the effect was the same.

Jerin didn't know if Q'docet's secret punishments were discovered and he had been told to stop, or if the man had just given up trying to break the boy.

Ayb was the next to be raised. That did not surprise anyone. If anyone in their Rank conformed to the ideal of the Order, it was Ayb. Ayb was strong and devout. He never put a foot wrong. As his face and frame had matured towards manhood, he had become even stronger and fitter. Of course, Ayb was in his bunk as he should be when the priests came to take him to the Hallows for his raising. The next day, a new priest was sitting at the head table at breakfast, a smiling youth who still wore the ceremonial robe. He was cradling a bandaged right hand, but it did not seem to dull the pride that he showed.

Almost immediately. Ayb was assigned to a missionary train that was heading North. North of Victoria, the Barrier Range broke, allowing a narrow valley leading through to the lands on the far side. The Plenne, the area was called, was not a forgiving place, but the people who lived there mined in the mountains and produced the ores that others smelted to provide valuable metal for the Order and Arnath. Such a mission would be cold and grey, spending; time in tiny mining villages. None of the boys in the Rank envied him.

"That would have been you," said Pol. The boys were on the roof of the Temple, looking down at the collection of pacers, burden beasts and wagons that made the mission. Guardsmen sat on their pacers, green and gold uniforms looking resplendent in the sunlight. "If you'd been raised." Pol was back to being Jerin's friend. It was maybe the best they'd ever been. Pol had appreciated Jerin's new outlook. He claimed that for the first time, Jerin was actually fun to be around. Neither of them had any illusions that they had a future in the Order. After spending most of their lives working and striving to be a part of the Order, they had both realized that neither of them would make the cut. At most, they had another year before being put out of the Temple. That realization was freeing.

Between the two of them, they had started handicapping each of the others in their Rank, betting which would be raised and in what order. Both Jerin and Pol had picked Ayb first, and Jerin thought Hume was second.

"He's like a little Q'docet," he'd said when they were discussing it. "There's no way that he will be passed over."

Seeing Ayb leaving only reinforced the feeling that everything was coming to an end. Even if Ayb had not been particularly close to Pol or Jerin, they had been together as a rank for twelve years. The future might look very different from the present.

"What d'you figure it'd be like?" Jerin asked.

"Being on a mission?" Pol replied. Jerin nodded. "Dunno. It's not like he's in charge of anything. The senior priest is going to be calling all the shots. I figure Ayb might be permitted to blow his own nose, but that's about it." Jerin smiled.

"Would be great to be going on a mission, I think. An adventure." He thought of the maps and the places he knew about outside of the city.

"There's better places to go than the Plenne," scoffed Pol. "I think that would be right at the bottom of my list. There's a reason that you were selected to be raised when you were. They probably wanted to send you to the end of the world and leave you there."

"Where would you want to go?" asked Jerin.

"I think some of the eastern areas would be good. Be an opportunity to get away from the city. I've heard things are pretty quiet. Sit back and watch the sheep grow wool."

"Not south?"

"Can't go south. Never get across the Rhed border."

"I didn't know that," said Jerin.

"Yeah, but my uncle's in the business. He has tried to trade with Rhed. But the priests watch the border on this side, and the Rhedmen patrol on the other. He barely escaped one time. Lost a big chunk of merchandise when he had to cut and run." Jerin didn't know much about Rhed. There were almost no books on it in the Library, and what few mentioned it were so vague as to be useless.

"I'd like to see the East," said Jerin. He let out a breath he didn't know he was holding when the Guards kicked their pacers into motion. Ayb's face was visible for a moment in the carriage window. He looked frightened. It was an odd thing to see on the boy who had always been the biggest, strongest and most sure.

Pol was the first to realize that they weren't alone on the rooftop. Jerin started and then automatically made a bow when he caught the sight of a priest's robes. He realized that it was Tulan a moment later and saw the annoyance in the old priest's eyes at the obeisance. "Sorry," said Jerin. Tulan grunted and then moved to look over the roof guarding wall at the disappearing backs of yellow and green. The procession was across the square and heading up the street that led straight to the north gate of Victoria.

"Be a while before you see your friend again," said Tulan. He grabbed his beard and tugged on it. "Poor bugger. Will be the winter up North by the time he gets there. I did a turn up there when I was younger. Months in a tiny mining camp. Wind and snow howling outside, and just the coal fire or the smelting to keep you warm. They sing songs there. Just something to take their minds off the cold and hard days, I think." He fixed an eye on Jerin. "I can't say as that you dodged an arrow there, young man."

"Better to still be an acolyte?" said Pol, trying to keep from grinning. Pol didn't know the old gardener the same way that Jerin did. Jerin knew that the man would appreciate the jest.

And he did: he smiled. "You might say that. Even so, that might have been your best chance, lad. Not a word of a lie." He made the sign of the bowl and the sphere to punctuate the thought.

"I know," said Jerin, his voice soft. "I can't seem to stay out of trouble long enough for them to raise me. Can't see that changing any time soon."

"You and me both," said Pol. "I think they'd raise a duck before me."

"You got family. You're Pol, right?" Tulan stuck out a hand and Pol froze for a moment before he grasped it. A quick shake and Tulan released it. "Yes, *magister*," said Pol. Jerin winced as he heard his friend use the honorific on the old priest. "Got family in business and in trade. I know my Dad'll be sore when I'm put out the Temple, but I think the cards are already dealt."

"It's not such a bad thing, business. I have a brother who's a tanner in town. Happily married. Had kids. Most of them grew up. I can't say that he's had a bad go of it." He sucked his teeth as he leaned on the wall. The green and yellow uniforms were almost out of sight now. It was a long ride to the city wall. The City of Victoria was something out of legend. The walls were enormous, thick, tall and impenetrable. Compared to the walls, the buildings inside were a small, impermanent mix of buidling styles that had grown up over an unknown amount of time. Like the Temple, the city had grown, but always within the monolithic walls. There were some old tales of a war fought at the site, but not even the wisest of the priests knew any more than that. None knew how the walls had been made, either.

The boys took their leave of the priest, and found ther way back into the Temple by one of the crooked stairs that descended from the roof.

"Where are you headed?" asked Pol. Jerin had to think. It was an hour before the noonday meal, and classes had been waived for the ceremony of the departing mission.

"Library?" said Jerin. He didn't have any plan. The afternoon would be chores.

"Whatever." said Pol. As being in the oldest Rank of acolytes, they now had permission to enter the Library and choose from most of the books if they wished.

They worked their way through the twisting halls. As they approached the library, the halls got larger and straighter. This was the core of the Temple, and one of the first parts. The Library was quiet as usual. The private studies that the priests used all that the doors shut. The large tables in the centre of the room were empty. There was the musty smell of the books, but also the smell of new plaster. Jerin couldn't help himself when he looked up at the place where he had accidentally put a hole in the library roof when he had caught himself from falling. The craftsmen had done a good job to match the old roof, but that the new bits were a little cleaner and a little whiter than the old. Pol saw what Jerin was looking at.

"You certainly punched a hole in that," he said. "You never did tell me what happened there. If you hadn't had plaster dust all over when you got back to bed, you might have gotten away with it."

"Don't remind me," grumbled Jerin. He snuck a glance to where Nessa had been waiting for him. "Totally worth it, though." He said the last softly enough that Pol couldn't hear. Pol was moving into the stacks, going to the place right under the repair. He was looking up at the shelves when Jerin caught up.

"There's a way in and out of the Library up there?" he asked. From this point, you could not see the alcoves above the shelves.

"Yeah. Used to be a balcony up there. Rotted away a thousand years ago, I think," said Jerin. "You want to see?" Pol looked around as though expecting someone else to be watching, and then grinned. Quietly, the boys climbed up the massive shelves. As they rose higher, the books got older and less-cared for. Jerin wondered if some of the volumes were rotted away, too. They reached the top without too much trouble, and then Pol could see the alcoves. He heaved himself up to the top and then made his way into the dim place.

"Cool," he said.

"Deserted," said Jerin. He and Nessa had found a number of rooms off this place, all empty except for a few abandoned items rotting into dust.

"Not quite," came a girl's voice.

"Melior protect..." Pol bit off the curse as he jumped back, eyeing the drop into the Library behind him. Jerin recognized the voice immediately and a big grin split his face.

"Nessa, what are you dong here?" he said. "A little early to be prowling the Temple." He kept his voice down so as not to have it carry. Nessa was dressed in a medium brown dress, with an off-white blouse under it. She was barefoot though, for treading quietly. She had a small scrip over her shoulder, and her dark hair was tied back with a brown kerchief. Not at all undressed the way she had been when Jerin had seen and felt her last. His face heated at as those memories percolated up into his mind.

Nessa indicated her scrip. "I was returning a book. Figured it would be a tomb in here with the misson leaving."

"I can put it back for you," said Jerin, putting out a hand. "Need anything to take with you?"

"Jerin!" Pol hissed.

"What?" said the taller boy.

"Do you not learn anything?" he waved at Nessa, frustration on his face. "She needs to get out of here. Right now. Before she's caught. Before you're caught. Before I'm..." he trailed off. "The Trinity protect me. Before I... I gotta get out of here."

"Pol..." said Jerin as his friend started swing his legs over the edge and found a toehold and started climbing down.

"You're not wrong," said Nessa to the departing Pol. "I don't know why Jerin sticks around. I think he's as crazy as I am."

"Go ahead and laugh," said Pol. His whisper came up from halfway down the stacks. Jerin put out a hand, and Nessa opened her scrip and pulled out the book she had taken. Jerin went to the edge and looked down. As Pol reached the floor, he looked up.

"Catch," said Jerin. He dropped the book. Pol's eyes went wide and he tried to catch it, but the tome slipped throgh his grasp and tumbled to the floor with a loud bang. "Uh oh," said Jerin and he backed away from the edge. He felt Nessa's hand in his as they retreated. There were sounds of study doors opening and soon there would be priests looking for the source of the sound. They were jumpy since the hole had been ripped in the roof.

Nessa and Jerin crept away, his soft slippers almost as good as as her bare feet. The darkness closed in until it was black. But he knew how far it was to the invisible intersection. He was surprised to find her hand still in his. It felt warm and so... foreign. It was strange and wonderful to hold someone's hand, even if it was with his damaged one. Without warning, there was a pull on his hand and he stopped and turned. He wondered what was the matter when he felt Nessa's invisible form come close to him in the dark. It took a bit of fumbling, but soon her lips were on his in a kiss. Jerin had absolutely no idea what to do. He barely knew what a kiss was. But it felt good, and Nessa seemed to enjoy it too, as it lasted several seconds. Then she pulled away and was tugging on Jerin's hand to keep moving.

She turned away from the main passage and then there was a dim light as she pushed open one of the doors to a deserted room. The windows in the room were shuttered, but in the daylight, enough light leaked through to seem bright compared to the black passage. Jerin slipped through and pushed the door closed behind him. His lips still tingled from the kiss. To his surprise and delight, Nessa gave him another one when they reached the center of the room. This time he could see her, but it was so strange seeing her so close that he closed his eyes. When it was over, it took a moment to open them.

"Jerin, I am so sorry that you got in trouble again because of me." It took Jerin several seconds to understand what Nessa was talking about.

"Oh, that night. With the roof. Yeah." He pushed a hand through his hair. "At least this time you weren't caught too. That would have made it worse." He rubbed at the scar on his right hand.  "For both of us," he added. As far as the priests had known, he was out of bed and had had something to do with the damage to the Library roof, but there was no more than that. The punishment for that had been bad enough.

"So?" she asked. She seemed to be waiting for him to say something.

"So?" he echoed back, confused. Her eyes were on him. Jerin didn't know what she was waiting for.

"I saw you fly," she said. "I know I didn't imagine it." She took a step back, looking him over.

Jerin realized that there was so much to tell her. He had gotten used to Pol knowing what had happened and what he experienced, but this was only the second time he had seen Nessa since his encounter with the Bowl and Sphere. It was then that he became aware of the invisible threads around him. He ignored them most of the time, but when he focused, they became clear to him. And one of them was extending directly from his left hand to her left breast. He colored all over again, but was thankful for the dim light of the room that hid it.

"Um, yeah, I did," he managed to say. "It's complicated."

"I guess so," Nessa murmured. "Can you do it now?" Jerin searched around, but there were no threads that were passing through this room moving in the right way.

"It was just luck," he said.

"Luck? I don't care how lucky you are, that's not going to make you fly," said Nessa, her mouth quirked in a smile.

"I mean, my falling and there was... I mean it was going the right way. It..." he took a deep breath.  "Look, I had something... happen to me. I did something I shouldn't have a while ago and it changed me." He searched her face for any sign that she understood what he was saying. She was looking expectant, but nothing more. He tried again.

"You know this?" he pointed to the embroidered version of the bowl and sphere on his breast.

"Of course I do," said Nessa.

"There's a real Artifact, right? And it's here in the Temple." He saw Nessa nod. "I... a couple of years ago, I went down to the place where it's kept."

"The room in behind the Hallows? Yeah, I've seen where it was." Jerin remembered the very first time he had seen Nessa's eyes shining from the shadows. It had been so long ago, in the Hallows.

"Well, I... went in. You promise you won't tell anyone?" He knew it was a stupid question as soon as he said it. "I went in. With Pol. And, well, I touched the Artifact."

"You touched it?" Nessa said. There was awe in her voice. That gave Jerin a little jolt of pride. She was impressed.

"Yeah, and it knocked me out. Literally. I woke up a bit later and then was in the infirmary for a couple weeks." He remembered that he had fallen when he blacked out. "I hit my head, so I think a lot of the reason I needed healing was that, but it did knock me out."

"So it really is a powerful thing, and not just a symbol?" breathed Nessa. Jerin could see that her eyes were bright. No one except the priests of the Order and the acolytes who were being raised ever saw the Artifact. There were replicas and symbols everywhere, but they were all crude copies.

"And the sphere, it just hangs there. It isn't connected to anything. It's unbelievable." Jerin hadn't thought much about the actual experience since it had happened. "And the room is weird with raw stone and a light that comes from everywhere and nowhere at the same time. He felt himself getting excited with the memories. He had gone there more as an act of rebellion than as an adventure, but when he told the story, it felt like an adventure.

"So it knocked you out when you touched it?" Nessa asked.

"Not exactly. The space under the sphere... it... I don't know how it works, but I put my hand there. It's not that important," he said.

"Maybe it is. How big is it?" Jerin tried to remember. He spread his arms wide in a curving shape. "So you had to lean in to do it?"

"Sort of, yeah. It just seemed—I wanted to feel if there was anything holding up the ball." He shook his head. He was totally off-topic. "Anyways, when I woke up later, I started to see things. It was only dim, or blurry at first, but ever since it's gotten clearer."

"What kind of things?" asked Nessa. Her eyes were bright again.

"I don't know that I would believe this if someone told me," he said.

"Jerin, I saw you fly. I want to know." Jerin exhaled and started pacing.

"It's like... there are lines, connecting things. A line between point A and point B, connecting them. I think that's what they are, anyways. I don't know. I've never found anything about them in the Library, and you'd think the priests would know about this. It's their artifact, after all."

"There was a connection, from me to Pol. It's still there. I don't know why. I can tell you where he is." Without even thinking, Jerin pointed in the direction of one of the walls, and a little lower. They were up at the level of the alcoves above the Library. Jerin thought that Pol was probably somewhere nearer to the mess hall on the main level of the Temple. "But that's not the only one. There are these... lines... always coming along. I don't know for sure what they are connecting. Something really big and really far away, I think."

"They are in this room?" Nessa was looking around. The line from his hand was pointing directly at her. Now that he was paying attention, it was distracting.

"Sometimes. They come and go. There are a few near, but none that are just right. That's what I meant about being lucky. There was one coming at the right time in the right place in the right direction." He thought about the hole in the roof, but then he didn't enjoy the idea of falling to the floor of the Library.

"I can touch them," he said.

"Can I touch them?"

"I don't think so. I tried a lot of times with Pol. He never felt a thing when I guided him to where they were."

"What about the one that connected you two?" Jerin remembered trying to figure that out with Pol.

"We tried, but couldn't tell if he could feel anything or if it was just knowing where I was. If it was anything, it wasn't much."

"How was it connected?" Nessa asked.

"Like how did it happen? I don't know. It's straight from here," he pointed at the center of his chest, "to the same on Pol." He resumed his pacing. If he didn't look at Nessa, he wouldn't see the thread that was running to her.

"Can I ask you a question?" she asked. Jerin paused. Nessa didn't wait for an answer. "Is there anything connecting you to me?" Jerin felt a cold splash in his innards. A sweat broke out on his brow. He tried to say something, but nothing came out.

"Because I've had the oddest sensation since the other night. What you're saying makes sense to me. And maybe I can feel it because, well, because it's in a more sensitive spot." Her dark eyes were fixed on his blue ones. Jerin didn't feel like he could pull away from her gaze.

"Um, I think, well... yes..." was all Jerin was able to stammer out.

"So you did this, but don't know what you did." She said it as a statement. She sounded more sure of what he could do than he was.  Nessa stepped close and looked Jerin over. "I can feel it here." She put her right hand on her left breast. Care to tell me where the other end is, or should I start guessing?"

"I don't know how it happenedl" said Jerin, waving his arms.

"I felt that," Nessa said. Jerin immediately crossed his arms in front of his chest. "I'm not saying it wasn't welcome." There was a silence. Jerin didn't know what to say, and Nessa seemed content to stare at him and smile. She broke the silence. "I can't do anything to this... thread thing." She made a grasping motion in front of her breast, but nothing happened.

"No, but," Jerin began. With his damaged right hand, he reached the fiber in front of his anchored left. He grabbed hold of the invisible strand and plucked it. Unlike the large ones that came and went, this one bent obviously to his eye. There was not nearly as much energy in it. He let it snap back. Nessa's eyes went wide and both of her hands clapped over her left breast.

"Ow," she said, rubbing a spot that she shouldn't have been.

"I'm sorry," said Jerin averting his eyes.

"And you think you got this when you touched the Artifact? Then why don't the priests do anything like this? They don't, do they?"

"I don't know. Like I said, I can't find anything about it. But it's almost impossible to find something in the library without telling the priests that guard it what you're looking for. If I told them that..."

"Then they'd ask why," finished Nessa. She went quiet. Jerin looked back at her, and she was no longer massaging her chest. She had one finger on her lips and she was looking at him speculatively. "I think we need an experiment."

"What?"

"An experiment. There is no way to confirm what happened without trying it again. And this time, maybe if I don't fall and hurt my head, we'll be able to say for sure that it was the Artifact that caused it." Jerin started to protest, but Nessa was already moving, grabbing his hand again. He might not have been the largest of the acolytes, but he was pretty sure he could have stopped her if he tried. But with her holding his hand, running with her down the dark hall seemed like the most natural thing in the world.

Melior sat astride one of the odd horse variant that the locals used. They called them pacers, but it was obviously some type of cross-bred horse that had survived the conditions here. Melior's long legs dangled a ridiculous amount on either side of it, almost brushing the long grass. He had a looking-glass in his hands, looking to the west where Reas' fortress lay.

"Looks exactly the same as it used to," he muttered loud enough for Levifid to hear. It didn't take a looking-glass to see the walls. It was early morning and the sun was lighting up the eastern wall in an orange glow. The wall was two kilometers from end to end and tall enough to be a tower here. Maybe eight or so stories, Levifid guessed. He'd never seen it himself. He had heard about it, and listened as the Order had pressed their attack, so many centuries ago.

It was continuing to frustrate them, not knowing exactly how long it had been since they were entombed under the *Compass Rose's* wreck. The effect of the crash and the resulting anarchy had obliterated the rudimentary records keeping of the young colony. To Levifid's amazement, all of the people that they had met so far hadn't even realized that they were the descendants of colonists. Such was the state of history in Arnath. The name of this country rankled Melior. In only a few milliseconds, he had connected the name to the now-ruined city that Reas had built. And that name had been of an inconsequential woman who Sicaria had killed before they'd ever left the *Compass Rose*. Certainly, there was a collective memory of Melior. Every person who they had met had also gone white and dropped to pray when Melior introduced himself. There were remnants of the Order and the Guards. The colors of their uniforms were probably the most constant thing about them. The Words were still studied, but as near as Melior and Levifid could determine, these lands were barely better off than the European Dark Ages.

The Order was here, in Reas' fortress. Victoria seemed an ironic name to Levifid, but irony wasn't his strong suit. Melior and Levifid were not alone. Sicaria stood next to Levifid and her crew of five monsters stood or floated or slithered a few respectful paces back. And beyond that were all of the priests and Guards that they had encountered on their journey from what had been the Yellow Zone to the Green. Some of the priests had resisted the idea that Melior was actually the one that the Words spoke of, but making an example of one or two had done much to make the remainder more faithful. They were a pitiful army, but there were no domini or even Order members who could work dark fibers.

"Looks like there is a gate on this side," observed Melior. "Three of them, in fact." He lowered the glass to his lap.

"We just walk in?" asked Levifid. Sicaria barked a laugh but did not contribute.

"I think not, my friend," said Melior. "I've had a thought or two on the trip and I'd like to see if it works out." He didn't say any more, even though Levifid gave him a long silence to fill.

## And Then There Were Two

Nessa led Jerin up the rough ramp from the floor of the room to the plinth where the Artifact stood. The room was every bit as strange as Jerin had said it was. Down this deep under the Temple, it was natural to expect raw bedrock, but everywhere but here the builders had worked the stone to disguise the place as halls instead of tunnels. But here, the walls were rough and glassy, like this was the heart of a volcano. There even was an odd orange light that brightened the room without making it anything more than spooky. The walls were lost in shadows when you were next to the Artifact, which was at the center of the light.

"Melior protect me," she breathed. It was the Artifact. It was right in front of her. "It's incredible." The bowl was about as big around as a large man might spread his arms, and seemingly made of rough, natural stone. It was a shallow thing. It was unlikely to draw attention, if it weren't for the ball of smooth stone that floated in the air above the center of it. That was unnatural and eerie. It didn't move at all. It looked as solid there at the stone of the plinth. Jerin was beside her looking at the Artifact, but also gawking all around.

"It's... they're everywhere," he said in a whisper.

"What are?" Nessa asked, looking around nervously for some observer.

"The threads. This place is full of them. The walls, the ceiling, the floor. The Artifact. You can't even..." he swallowed. "You can barely even see the Artifact for all the threads. They are... imagine a crazy spider working for a hundred years. I have never seen anything like it."

"Not even when you were here?" asked Nessa. Jerin shook his head. "Can you tell me anything about what's there?" she pointed into the center of the bowl.

"There's a mesh that fills the bowl. It—there's a pillar, almost, from the center to the sphere. The sphere... inside it's almost a lace. There's more fiber than stone."

"There?" Nessa pointed to the space right under the ball. She could see nothing except for the odd light that filled the area. Nessa stopped for a moment. She wanted to do this. It sounded like magic and she had to know what it was like. But she wasn't suicidal. She wanted to survive this and sleep in her own bed tonight. "Hold me," she said. When Jerin didn't move at once, she moved in front of him. She felt his hands take hold of her hips, but then move up to her waist. His grip was tentative. "Harder. I don't want to fall, Jerin." His grip firmed. She could feel his breath as he watched . She put her hand out, centimeter by centimeter. She kept expecting some sensation, some pain perhaps. The anticipation was so strong, and she wanted to pull her hand back. But she kept moving it forward, into the space between the two parts of the Artifact.

Then her hand was there, and nothing happened. Nessa kept it there for a moment before turning her head to try to look at Jerin. "Nothing's happening." she said. There was a pause before Jerin spoke.

"I... there was a flare or something for a moment. When you put your hand there, but it's gone. Try again." Nessa pulled her hand back, and then shoved it back into the air under the spere. Still, she felt nothing.

Pol hustled away from the Library. It had taken half an hour to finish apologizing for dropping a book to the priest who had found him. Pol had picked up the book and there was no damage, but the books were too valuable and too irreplaceable for incautious acolytes to be dropping. To top it all off, he had gotten extra chores as punishment. He was to skip the lunch meal, taking what he could and working the bell tower for the afternoon.

Pol was fuming. He had gotten in trouble, all because of Jerin's stupid infatuation with that girl. He was beginning to think that she was put on the planet for a the sole purpose of causing them pain. And to get caught in such a stupid way as dropping a book. He had done things in the past, pulled pranks that had left the Order scratching their heads over how it was done. If he was going to get caught and punished for something, it should at least be something worthwhile. That girl. He needed to figure out how to get Jerin to realize she was bad news. He'd tried once and that had been a disaster.

He grabbed one of the mobile meals from the kitchen, not bothering to go to the mess. Even if he sat for lunch without notifying the priests of his punishment, he would catch trouble later for not obeying the librarian. Better to follow the word of the doddering old fool to the letter. It wasn't that bad a day to be in the bell tower. He hated the work, though. As though reflecting his thoughts, the Temple bell rang out midday as he climbed the narrow stair that wound up to the heights. The peal was deafening when it echoed down the stair from the belfry above. Pol clapped his ears to hand to his ears, barely avoiding dropping his lunch. He didn't release them until the echoes had died away. He climbed the rest of the way and pushed the trapdoor open. He lifted his lunch up and then hauled himself up to the timber boards that made the floor of the belfry. The massive cast bronze bell hung in the space above it, the massive striker hanging on ropes next to it. The striker was still swinging from the midday toll, and the acolyte on duty was just sitting down. It was Peet, one of the boys two Ranks younger than Pol.

"Hey Peet," Pol said as he pushed the trapdoor closed.

"Pol? what're you doing here?" The boy Peet was taller than Pol, if as thin as a reed.

"Punishment," said Pol. He didn't want to go into it. The triviality of the crime was embarrassing. "You don't want to know." He hoped that would be the end.

"Am I supposed to go?" asked Peet.

"I have no idea. I was just sent here." Pol noted that Peet had his lunch, too. "I guess you can stay or go. I'd leave if I could." He grinned and the younger boy shared it.

"Yeah, but then I'd get other chores. And if you're here to ring the bell, that soundls like an afternoon off, don't it?"

Pol laughed. "You're a man after my own heart, Peet," he agreed. He sat down next to Peet and they both started in on their lunches. The view from the heights was amazing. It was the tallest building inside the wall, and even a taller than the wall itself. it was the only place in Victoria where you could see the lands outside. You didn't realize how confining that felt until you got up here and could see the difference. Most of the view was of the tilled fields in every direction. It was the early part of the growing seawon so everything was a new greenness. There were copses of trees and some small farmers' houses dotting the area, and the main roads from Victoria ran as dark brown lines through it all. The biggest road was the East road, heading to the distant villages and outposts. There was a regular trade along that way. The North road, that Ayb had just taken with the mission led off to the distant Barrier Range. Only on the clearest days could the white peaks of the mountains in the north come into view. Today was not one of those days. There were smaller roads, choked with green, that ran West and South. They boys were not here to keep watch. They were here to keep time. The City had Guards at each of the entrances. There was a sundial and a massive water-clock here to keep time. They were to ring the large bell on the hour and the smaller bells on the quarter-hours. It was not stimulating work and it was noisy, but it had to be done.

"I heard that , Q'docet was really pissed about Jerin being selected," said Peet around a mouthful of bread.

"He was," said Pol. He didn't really want to talk about Jerin right now, but it was understandable that the other Ranks woud be curious. "The Council went over his head. But that's over now."

"For good, probably," nodded Peet. Then he noticed Pol's stare. "What? It's not like N'patri was going to get another shot. Even this one was obviously a fight among the priests. It's not like we all make it, right?"

"No, we don't," said Pol. "But there's always a chance. Remember that."

"Oh, I know. It's just... what in the name of the Trinity is *that*?" Peet was leaning back against the railing, and was staring straight up. He bumped his head as he twisted and jumped to his feet. He put both hands on the rails and was looking up. Pol could not see anything from where he was sitting, but he got up and followed Peet to the railing. He looked up and froze.

It was a beautiful morning in Victoria. The sky was cloudless and blue. The sun was warm but not too hot. It made a glare in the sky, but even at midday, it was well south of being overhead. Occupying the zenith was a black square. Pol blinked several times to make sure that he was not seeing things. It looked as though there was a portal in the sky. If the sky were a blue ceiling that the sun marched across, then his was a hole in it, exposing the blackness beyond. That didn't make any sense to Pol, but that was what his brain was telling him.

"Start ringing the bell," said Pol. When Peet didn't start moving, Pol added, "Now!". His lunch forgotten, he scrambled to the trapdoor and yanked it open. "I'm going to run to tell them what's happening."

"Who?" asked Peet. He reached for the rope to pull the striker back.

"Everyone," said Pol as he slid through the trapdoor and fell a meter to the top of the stairs. He regained his footing and started sprinting down them two at a time. Above him, the bell started tolling. The sound chased him all the way down.

Nessa and Jerin were staring at the Artifact, stymied. Neither of them had worked out why the Artifact remained resolutely passive when Nessa did the same things that Jerin had. "Maybe it didn't do the things you think it did," said Nessa.

Jerin gave her a look, and she shrugged. "I am not just imagining things," he said. "You know that."

"Then what's the difference? I'm a person, same as you."

"Well, you are..." he let the sentence remain unfinished. It was obvious that she was a girl instead of a boy. Nessa turned away, unwilling to admit that might be the problem.

"You said it reacts and then falls silent again. What might it be expecting that we aren't doing?" she asked.

"We've discussed this already."

"What does it say in any of the texts about the Artifact? What about the Words? Anything there?" Nessa knew the Words, all citizens of Arnath had to, but Jerin had studied them for his whole life.

"Just that the Artifact will raise the Order above the mortal men who serve Melior and the Trinity. It doesn't get specific. I know that the acolytes come in here with the Order to be raised, but nobody knows what happens until, well it happens."

"I think I know the passage you mean," said Nessa. "Blessed are all who hold Me in their hearts, but above them are the Order. They have sacrificed and come through fire to be at my side. Blood and pain, they are come clean and will be a symbol of Me."

"Almost right," said Jerin. "It is *come through light* not *come through fire*. But that's it."

"Blood and pain. Remember when I met you?" Nessa saw a moment of confusion on Jerin's face. "My uncle? You were washing his blood off your robe."

"What about it?" asked Jerin.

"I was just thinking about the huge version of this that is in the square. the one that they decaptiate the convicted over. Their blood flows into the bowl. Blood and pain."

"That makes sense, but I didn't spill any blood into..." Jerin's voice died.

"What?"

"I was just thinking." Jerin's eyes were unfocused. "When Ayb was raised yesterday. He had a bandage on his hand. At the mess, afterwards. He was still wearing the ceremonial robe. Come to think of it, all of the raised priests had that. We'd joked about it all the time. I think some were nervous. The blood and pain part of the passage. We all knew it. But I never..." he was looking at the Artifact again. "When I climbed up here, I scraped my hand on the sharp edges. I barely remember it."

"So you might have bled into the bowl?" asked Nessa. Her heart was racing.

"But, if the acolytes being raised are bled, then why don't they end up like me? I'm pretty sure they don't, anyways." Nessa was fumbling in her pouch. She found her small knife there. With trembling fingers she brought it out.

"What are you doing?" Jerin's eyes were wide.

"Experimenting." Nessa tried to make her voice sound brave. The steel of the blade glittered in the strange light of the room. "You do it," she said, handing the knife to Jerin, handle-first.

Jerin backed away. "No, what? I'm not cutting you."

"I don't want to," said Nessa. Please?" she pushed the knife at him. Jerin grabbed at it, but pushed it back at her. The blade slipped between her fingers, and Nessa felt the sting of the metal scoring her. She sucked in a breath, then held her hand up. Blood was trickling down to her wrist already.

"Nessa! Oh, I'm sorry. Quick, put some pressure on it." Nessa waved him away. Deliberately, she put her injured right hand over the bowl. Red drops that were nearly black in the odd light splattered in the rough stone, and trickled towards the bottom, where they disappeared. Nessa was fascinated by what she saw. Pain was forgotten.

"Nessa, there is something happening. The sphere. It's doing something now." His voice brought her back to why she was here. Nessa thrust her hand into the space between the bowl and the sphere, and the world exploded. What had seemed to be a dark room before blazed into light. The vision pressed on her senses like a physical force. She was sure she screamed, but it was difficult to make any sense of what she was sensing. Nausea, vertigo and burning fiery pain raced through every part of her. The world slipped away from her.

Pol hung back behind the Council. Not knowing where else to go, and knowing that priests ate lunch like everyone else, he had burst into the mess to find a dozen of them at the upper table. At first, none of them had believed a word he was saying. The old librarian who had sent him to the tower as punishment had been incensed, thinkin that Pol was flaunting his orders. But everything had changed when Tulan had come in.

"You are still here?" he had said in a hiss to his peers. "Did Pol not tell you what is happening outside?" The priests had tried to take offense, but Tulan had cut them off. The tolling of the tower bell punctuated his words. "There is a hole in the sky out there. We need to assemble everyone. Now." Tulan had hustled them out of the hall, and Pol had followed. The acolytes who remained in the hall at the end of their lunch were watching the events unfold in front of them, but not realizing what was happening. They could hear the bell, but that didn't signify anything to them. It had never rung like this before.

The priests hadn't even reached the Grand Hall when they had met Rastus and the elders coming down the passageway. "Haven't seen it yet," the large priest had said. "But we should be unified. Out front, with the bowl in the courtyard. We should be able to see it from there and we can choose a course of action then." He hadn't invited any discussion, and had led the group back towards the grand entrance hall of the Temple. Pol was still in their wake, uncertain if he was supposed to stay or go. There didn't seem to be much point to returning to the bell tower, and he hadn't been dismissed by the priests.

The priests took a few steps past the main doors and then stopped, looking up. From here, the black square in the sky was almost directly overhead. From the bell tower, it had been north of overhead. He was doing some quick math to try and figure out how high it was when Rastus spoke.

"Unprecedented, unless my memory fails me. Any of you recall any account of something like this in the records?" He brought his gaze down from the sky to look at the men with him, and got nothing but shakes of the head and murmured "No, Highests".

"Then we are going to deal with this as a spiritual matter. We don't know what will come out of that, if anything." He pointed to some of the priests around him. "Summon all of the Order. Take ten of your most solid men and go to the local churches in the City. People are going to want reassurance. Take the acolytes to the Hallows, excepting what few we need as runners. Again, make sure they are solid boys, who will follow directions. The Guards we will want at every entrance to the Temple, and on the heights. The entrances to the courtyard, too. I'm going to assume that if something comes out of there, it won't bother to go outside the walls of the city first and knock."

Pol felt calmer. Hearing Rastus take command like this made him feel like he was a part of something. He was a part of a group of his elders and no matter what happened, they would all try to solve the problems together. Rastus had been one of the leaders of the Guards, and it showed.

Pol was wondering what he should do, when Tulan took notice of him. "Pol, lad. What're you doing here? follow Elder Jan. He's heading to round up the acolytes and take them to the Hallows. It's the safest spot." He spared a glance upwards. "Pray, boy. Don't know if it will help, but if ever it was going to, now's the time."

Pol bowed and took two steps when there was a screech. It was a horrible thing, like some giant bird of prey that had been robbed of its kill. Pol stumbled and fell to his knees trying to look up and navigate the shallow steps up to the Temple doors at the same time. From his hands and knees, Pol twisted to look upwards. The dark square in the sky was not empty any longer. Two dark figures were swirling around it. Neither looked exactly human, but probably were the right size and shape. One was like a person draped in wispy cloth, tatters of a voluminous robe. The other was hard to pin down. It was almost like you could see through them. It was its motion that really allowed Pol to see it at all.

"What are those?" he asked to no one in particular. He was mesmerized by their swirls as he laid back on the stone steps. The screech repeated. The shapes were coming lower in larger circles. Soon they were circling just over the roofs the buildings that flanked the courtyard facing the Temple. Pol clapped his hands over his ears as the screech came from right over his head. It was the wispy figure. Now that it was closer, Pol could see that it was wearing a dark hood and a cloak that terminated in long rags. It did not seem to have any feet. He closed his eyes with his hands over his ears.

"Nessa! Nessa!" Jerin called to her. He cradled her in his arms. She was not conscious and her eyes were staring. He rocked her and chafed her wrists. She had slumped forward when she put her bleeding hand into the Artifact and he had just barely caught her as she slid to the narrow rock platform that supported the Artifact. He had let her down gently, and now was trying to get her to wake. She was not dead. Her chest rose and fell, and her pulse was strong. But she was as limp as a boned fish. Jerin looked around to see if he could move her to somewhere less precarious, but there was no way. He was not the largest boy, and she could offer no help. He was likely to drop Nessa on the way down the steep, uneven stairs that led down. "Come on, Nessa," he brushed the hair away from her face. He brushed his hand over her eyelids to lower them. It was too weird with her eyes open and staring. "Come on, Nessa. Wake up, please," Jerin continued rocking her.

He wished Pol were here. The two of them would have been able to lift Nessa and take her away to a place where she could recover. Any place was better than here. Pol had managed to drag him a little ways away, but he had fallen from the height down to the floor of the room. The head injury was enough to make him not want to try to do it.

Nessa stirred. She was not awake, but it was the first sign since she fell. "That's it. Come on, you can do it," Jerin said. She felt good, cradled in his arms. For years, he had known that girls were forbidden, both in the Temple and in general to the Order. They were made to be something less. Something not to be trusted, something less than human. Jerin had always felt that Nessa was a person, and one of the two people on the planet that he considered friends. Now, unconscious in his arms, Nessa felt more real than ever before. He could feel her breathing, her pulse. She was alive. A living, breathing person. It made Jerin wonder all over again why the teachings of the Order excluded someone as wonderful as this person.

Nessa's eyes opened, and this time they were focusing, not staring. They immediately sought Jerin's face. There was a look of relief, then she -closed them again.

"Hey there, did you have a good sleep?" he asked. He kept his voice light. It took a moment, but Nessa's mouth quirked a bit.

"Blood and pain. They had that right. I could sleep for days right now."

"We can't do that. Do you remember where we are?" asked Jerin. Nessa's eyes opened again, looking into the shadows of the room's ceiling. There was a look of recognition. "Yeah, that's right, we have to leave. Do you think you can stand?"

"I will try," Nessa whispered. Jerin unfolded her from his arms and tried to be gentle as he helped guide Nessa to her feet.

"Steady," he said as she wobbled when she regained her feet. Nessa put one arm over Jerin's shoulders and Jerin put his arm around her waist. Together, they started down the steep path. Her weight on his shoulders and her slim waist under his hand was intensely stimulating to Jerin. Other than wrestling in the hand-to-hand training, he never really touched anyone. It was distracting. He tried his best to ignore it.

They made it down with only one stumble. They had managed to not fall, but ended up with Nessa hanging on to Jerin with both arms and Jerin clutching the rock with his good hand. A few steps and they were across the floor, to the heavy, short doors that led out.

Jerin put his hand on the handle but paused before turning it. There was sound coming from the other side of the door. He heard a man's voice and an answer from a higher voice. There was a low murmur that was easy to hear above the echoing silence of the Artifact chamber when he was paying attention, that was.

"What is it? " Nessa asked. She was still not fully aware, stumbling beside him. Jerin let her down to the floor as gently as he could. Nessa sat down hard, but didn't complain. Jerin pulled his hands away slowly, ready to catch her if she started to fall, but she remained upright. Cautiously, Jerin put his ear to the door. There were many indistinct voices from the other side. *What could be happening?* he asked himself. The Hallows were always deserted, except for special services. This afternoon was nothing special. *In fact, I'm probably late for chores by now,* he thought. Even if there was to be a raising this afternoon, it would not warrant a gathering. Most were quiet ceremonies with no one in attentace. No one was allowed in the Artifact chamber except the priests and the acolyte,.

Barely daring to breathe, Jerin turned the handle until he felt the click of the latch freeing. Controlling his hands from shaking, he pulled the door inward a fraction of a centimeter at a time until there was a crack of light around the frame. He put his eye to the crack to look out. The Hallows were full. All of the benches were filled with white acolyte robes and there were priests dotting the room. Jerin eased the door shut again, then put his head against it, closing his eyes.

"We're not going out that way," he said.

## The Trinity Descends

Levifid felt a self-loathing that bordered on physical pain. He knew that none of it was betrayed on his face, but he felt it nonetheless. His emotional inhibitors were clamped down on him like invisible manacles. To be a part of this pageantry, about to descend upon the residents of Victoria, was repulsive to him. And yet he could see no alternative. Melior was the dominus in charge. Any attempt to prevent this or talk him out of it was a useless gesture that at best would spend some of the trust Melior had for him, and at worst might be lethal. Levifid didn't know how many people lived in the city below, but from what he had seen so far, they enjoyed a standard of living that was much lower than the colonists originally intended, but it was much better than in the little villages that they had visited so far.

Melior was about to disrupt their lives, hijacking than as pawns in his games that he was playing. Levifid didn't pretend to understand Melior's motivations. But he could recognize his passion and his intensity. The dominus had a goal, and these people were going to pay a price. Melior was there, looking a specter himself in the darkness of this void that Sicaria had made. It was like a room with a hole in the floor. The room's interior was black except for the light that came in from the hole, and Levifid understood from Melior's description that the outer walls were like a perfect version of the illusion that Sicaria had bound to the Shade. They were standing in the green room, offstage on the biggest pageant that the city will have ever seen, and Levifid wished he were anywhere else. His dominus intellect could not help but go over and over every decision that had brought him here and feel the weight of his culpability.

But if he was at fault, certainly the Universe played a part. That they had survived the crash of the Compass Rose still boggled his mind. Death and the Shade were out and drawing the attention of everyone in the city. The Serpent and Crawler and Punisher were approaching the North gate of the city along with the Guards. They would not be enough to break through if there was a stern defense, but Levifid agreed with Melior  that they would overcome any resistance that the City might put up.

The Five were surprisingly willing participants. As their ability to understand the language improved, Levifid and Melior had learned more and more about this time and place. And when the Five had been able to understand what Sicaria had done to them and that they had been dying of radiation poisoning, they had accepted their new positions with an enthusiasm that shocked Levifid.

"Wouldn't you?" asked Melior when Levifid had expressed these thoughts to him. "To go from a certain, slow, agonizing death to being superhuman and the assistants to the new power on the planet? If I understand their stories rightly, their lives before were no picnic."

"But... the way she deformed them," Levifid protested. It felt like a protest to him, but to an outsider he would have appeared completely calm and neutral. "It was torture."

"The mind is a resilient thing," smirked Melior. "Expecially in the hands of one as skilled as our Sicaria. At this point, I doubt any of them remember any of it. They might barely remember why there they were there in the wreck." *So that was it.* They were not as enthusiastic as Levifid had first thought. It was like the original Order all over again. A compliant force, ready-made. It didn't make Levifid feel any better about how the Five were throwing themselves into their new roles.

Event their names had been adopted willingly. Although in the new language they were different from what Levifid might have expected. It was beginning to get blurry in his own mind when he was speaking in the new dialect or in English. Sicaria was not showing any signs of learning the new, but Melior had adopted it and now was speaking like he had been born inthe Eastern Marches.

"It is time," said Melior. Levifid suppressed a sigh and stepped to the edge of the hole in the dark, and stepped out a moment after Melior and Sicaria.

"Look!" one of the priests shouted. No one needed to be prompted. Every eye was on the black hole in the sky, even Pol, who had yet to rise from the stairs. He felt frozen, watching the spectacle unfold above him. The two dark flying figures had sprialled back into a position above the courtyard, but that was not what had prompted the shout. From the black square, three figures had emerged, falling down towards the ground, but slowing as they fell until they alighted gently in the middle of the space, standing facing the assembled priests. Idly, Pol noticed that the black square had winked out of existence, leaving no clue that it had ever existed. The bell in the heights tolled three more times, and then fell silent.

Into the silence, the foremost of the three figures spoke. "I am Melior, come unto you as I foretold."

"I'm alright, Jerin," said Nessa as she got to her feet. Jerin was trying to help her up, but she waved him away. "I will be okay in a moment." Jerin tried to study her face, but the dim light of the Artifact chamber made it difficult. "Assuming no one finds us here, that is." There was a flash of white teeth as she made the joke. Jerin tried to laugh, but it came out strangled.

"There's half the Temple out there," he said in a whisper. He didn't think his voice would penetrate the door, but there was no harm in being careful.

"Is there any other way out?" asked Nessa. Jerin shook his head. She paused for a moment, considering. "You think that you can sneak out?"

"Not much chance," said Jerin. "I might be able to blend in, but you..."

"I didn't mean me," she said. "I didn't think I could. But if you could, that would be something."

"No way," protested Jerin. "I'm not leaving you alone in here."

"I want you to try," said Nessa. Jerin started to protest again, but Nessa raised a hand to stop him. "You might get out. Then if I'm caught it will just be me. You won't—"

"You'll face the headsman," hissed Jerin. It hadn't occurred to Jerin until that moment that that might be the consequence of their rash behavior, but as soon as he said it, he could envision it. "I couldn't live with that."

"Better just me than both of us. Don't try to deny it, Jerin. You'd get the same or worse."

They continued to argue quietly, neither of them willing to budge. As they did, Jerin noticed that Nessa was getting stronger, better able to hold herself upright without wavering. In the end, nothing was settled.

"How long do you think they will be out there?" Nessa asked when silence had taken the room again. They could heard the low sounds of the crowd outside.

"No idea. I have no clue why they are there. Without knowing that, I couldn't say."

"You think they'll come in here?" Nessa was eyeing the room. There were shadows in the edges of the room. The plinth that supported the Artifact was in the center of the room. Several people could hide behind it, but if anyone were to walk around it, they would be spotted immediately.

Jerin gave her a look. "I just said I don't know why they are out there. No one ever comes in here except for raisings. I think we're safe, but I just don't know."

"Then we have to wait. I think I'd rather wait over there, in behind the rock, if it's all the same to you."

The three figures in the courtyard stood still, waiting for any sort of reaction from the assembled priests. Pol was trying to digest what he had heard.

*I am Melior.*

It seemed impossible. He was exceedingly tall. Pol didn't think he had ever seen anyone as tall as this man. He looked to be in his late middle years, with salt and pepper at the temples of his short-cropped hair. Most of his hair was dark, and his face was a pale color that he didn't think he had seen before, even on the priests who never ventured outside the Temple. The man's face was long, and this his body was long and his limbs were long. To Pol, he seemed to be a man who had been melted and stretched, like the pulled sugar candy that they made in the shop down the block from his father's. The man's companions weren't much better. The other man drew his gaze next.

He was built almost the same as the first, and was a younger version, with no lines marking his face or discoloring his dark hair. But he was clean-shaven and drawn, much like the older one. While the first had a victorious look on his face, this younger one was emotionless, almost looking bored to be where he was.

Pol looked at the last one, at first thinking that she was the normal one, but realized that he was mistaken as soon as he focused on her. This was a woman, with an odd, slightly tinted skin and thick, long black hair. She was not abnormally tall, although Pol would still have had to look up to meet her gaze. Not that he would want to. This woman's eyes had a crazed look to them, even from the distance. Her mouth was twisted in a look of contempt, and in her hands was a long sword. It was unsheathed, and she held it sloppily, with the point touching the ground carelessly. If Captain Decco had ever seen any of the boys in the weapons classes do that, it would have meant pushups until the end of class.

All were dressed in somber robes, wrapping their figures in shadow. *Wait, Melior?* Was all that Pol could think. His mind wanted to rebel at the thought. It was impossible that Melior could have returned. And yet for his whole life, Pol had learned the catechisms that spoke of exactly that. Melior would return. It was the foundation of the teachings of the Order, passed down from before the Apocalypse. And yet Pol could not fit such an idea into his brain at first. When the shock started to recede, then Pol started to put names to the other two. A small, dark figure of violence and anger. The barely tame wolf on the leash of... He realized that he was looking at Sicaria and Levifid. Sicaria, the executioner. Levifid, the wise counsellor. Together, they were...

The Trinity.

## Decapitation

Pol was the first to move, changing from his sprawling position behind the collection of priests to get on his knees and bow so low that his forehead was resting on his hands on the stone step. The priests might have been slower than he was, but they were dropping to their knees when Pol put his head down. Pol stared at the backs of his hands. He didn't want to be here. *Of all the times to be where I shouldn't.* He went over all of the places he'd rather be, and it was a list of esentially everywhere else in the Temple and the City.

He could be wherever Jerin and Nessa were. Wherever that was, it was better than this. Why couldn't he have just ignored the girl? He could have been some place other than facing the actual, living gods that he had been learning about and following the words of for his whole life. He knew enough of the Words to fear what might come next. Pol listened, not daring to lift his head so much as a finger width.

"We see you, O Melior," came the baritone voice of Rastus. "Your coming was foretold and it gives us joy to see it come." There was a long, pregnant pause. Then the voice of the one who called himself Melior spoke again. The voice was much nearer. He must have approached. Pol did not raise his head to see.

"Yes, it was foretold." The voice of the strange man was deep, as though his voice were as drawn as the rest of his body. "Perhaps after a longer time than originally intended, but some things were difficult to foresee." There was a rustling of cloth. Pol caught the priests bowing deeper from the corner of his eye. He did the same. "From your robes, I perceive that you are the head of the Order. Am I correct?"

"That I am. I live to serve." Pol was impressed by how steady Rastus' voice was. As is it was, Pol was not sure he could have summoned more than a squeak. His mouth was bone dry.

"And yet, I am to understand that your subordinates refer to you as *Highest*. It seems an odd appellation for one who lives to serve." Melior's tone was level, but there was an indication of sarcasm.

"I... It is a title of respect, O Melior. One that comes from the long past. It is nothing."

"I see." There was another long pause. "And this place is your Temple to me. The Trinity, the three who are as one?"

"It is, O Melior." Rastus' voice sounded a little stronger after being rattled by the previous question. "It is the heart of Arnath. The place where the faith is strong and is reborn with each generation."

"Do you know what this place is?" asked Melior.

"It is the City. Victoria. The place where Melior... you... won your final victory, delivering us from the Dominion. Where Reas the Damned was overcome and defeated. Victoria."

"Reas the Damned. I like the sound of that," mused Melior. "What do you think, Levifid?" a suitable title for that one, don't you think?"

"I think that he was damned, either by his own actions or inaction. It makes no difference." That was the voice of the other tall man. *I knew it,* thought Pol, proud of his deduction even if he was in mortal danger.

"HEAR ME, PEOPLE OF VICTORIA," Pol clapped his hands over his ears as Melior's voice boomed. There was no way that any human could make their voice as loud as that. "YOU WILL ASSEMBLE IN THE SQUARE IN FRONT OF THE TEMPLE. I WILL NOT BE PATIENT. NO ONE IS EXEMPT." The sound of Melior's voice faded away in echoes until silence retook the courtyard. No one dared speak, not even the Highest. Melior did not say anything, just let the silence sink in. Pol noticed some of the priests fidgeting a little. Whether it was nerves or it was the fact that they were not accustomed to kneeling this long, he didn't know. They were the leaders of the Order. Rastus, the Highest, Elban and Erian, the two eldest in the Temple. Q'sloan, the head of the instructors, and Fright, the leader of the Holy Guards. Three others, Pol didn't know by sight, but one was the librarian who had given him his punishment.

Pol considered his options. He wanted to slowly creep away, but he didn't think that he would be unnoticed. He was wearing white and was only a few meters away. He dared sneak glances at the three strangers. They were standing and waiting. Levifid was looking almost bored, and watching Sicaria more than the priests or the growing crowd of Victorians who were entering the square. Sicaria was pacing, her sword tip scraping along the flagstones of the courtyard. She was watching only the priests. She paid no attention to the incoming citizens. Melior was watching the growing crowd. His back was to Pol, and his hands were clasped behind him.

He might have been able to run, but while he could outrun any of the priests, he had no illusions that his feet would be able to outpace any beings that descended from the sky. He began to pray. Then he had to bite his lip to stop from laughing. It was a hysterical laugh that threatened to erupt from him. He was praying to the being who was standing not five meters from him... to save him from the same being. The irony of it wanted to overcome him.

The crowd must have grown to the right size, because Melior began speaking again. His voice was amplified, but not to the extent that it had been. It was enough to carry to the farthest corners of the square.

"Citizens of Victoria, the capital city of Arnath," he began. "It has been too long. It seems that it has been so long that I have to introduce myself, as I did to the leaders of the Order just now. My name is Melior." There was a ripple through the crowd. Some was incredulousness, some was shock. "My associates are Levifid and Sicaria. No doubt these names are familiar to you. We are the Trinity. The Order has done this much for you at least: you recognize who we are now." He waited for a few moments while the stir in the crowd quieted again.

"We have traveled some way to get here today. Along that road, we visited a number of the villages in the Eastern Marches. We learned a number of things speaking with those who live there. They were quick to see the error of their ways. They knew the Words, but did not live with them in their hearts. Those who remain alive are now much more committed to the vision of Arnath that should not have ever been lost. They are making their way here now." There were disturbances at each of the entrances to the courtyard, each of the streets radiating to the compass directions.

Pol could not help himself. He raised his head to see. From his position on the stairs, he could see over the crowd: they were all kneeling. Green and gold uniforms were massed at each of the entrances. They were the colors of the Guards, but Pol suspected that these had different loyalty now.

"You cannot imagine how disappointed I am." Melior's voice rang out over the crowd. "When I left you, I had a vision. This land and these people." He gestured to the crowd. "Rulers over all. The one strong hand on the planet. Going forth in my name and conquering. That was the mandate of the Order. But what do I find?"

"I find tiny villages. I find livestock. I find a few token priests, mouthing the Words. I find no evidence of anything except pathetic devolution. This place? A city?" He barked a laugh. "This was but a tiny fortress made by my mortal enemy. This is a pathetic excuse for a town. And it is ruled in my name." Melior turned from the crowd and faced the priests. Pol ducked his head back down, but kept the Trinity visible under his brows. "I consider that an insut." His voice still projected, but it was low and threatening.

"O Melior..." Rastus began.

"SILENCE!" Melior bellowed. Rastus did not dare utter another syllable.

"When talking to many of the residents of these mean villages of the East, I understand that there are some interesting new rituals that you have instituted. I don't think that the many hundreds of years are a complete loss if the poetry of those rituals has allowed you to rise above your forebears." Pol let out a breath. Sweat was collecting in a bead on the tip of his nose. He was chilled all over.

"Let us see how poetic they are, shall we?" Melior asked. Pol froze. "I see an acolyte here. Stand, boy." Pol nearly lost control of his bladder, but managed to pull himself to his feet. He couldn't bring himself to look Melior in the face. "I understand that this is how it goes. Here, hold this sword out." Without anything holding it up, the sword that Sicaria had been holding floated through the air to come to a stop, horizontal to the ground, at Pol's eye level. Pol stared at the long, silver length for a second or two before he put out his hands, palms up, and the sword settled on them.

*I know how this is going to end,* he thought. His eyes flickered towards the still-kneeling priests. There was a cracking sound that drew the eyes of every assembled person. The headsman's block had detached itself from the rim of the large re-creation of the bowl and sphere that stood at the edge of the large raised area. It flew until it came to a stop on the flagstones in front of Melior. Levifid casually moved out of the way to let it land. There was a scream and some other sounds from the crowd. A figure was making his way towards Melior, striding through the kneeling citizens.

Pol had thought he had seen everything today, but apparently there were more surprises. The figure was a mountain of a man, but one that was grotesquely muscled. He wore only pants, his upper body was unclad, showing muscles that were like no man had ever had. The skin was covered in raised veins, making the man a horrific sight. This man stopped in front of Melior, bowed deeply, and then stood to the side, facing the crowd.

"As I understand it, the ritual goes like this. There is a prayer to Me. I think we can skip that part. Then the charges are read out for the accused. Rastus, Highest of the Order, you stand accused of extreme negligence and dereliction of duty. While you are not the only one who has held the title of Highest, you are the only one here to answer for the sins of yourself and those who came before you. The Order's lack of leadership has left Arnath in a pitiful state. For that, your life is forfeit." Rastus lifted up from where he was bowing. Unwillingly, he was dragged to a kneeling position at the block.

"My Lord! I protest! I have served you! I have served you all and led the Order in your names."' His shouts were cut off as though a gag had been put in his mouth.

"The prisoner will be silent. May your soul be strong and everlasting. In My name." Melior stepped back, allowing the horribly muscled man to step up.

"Punisher, please," said Melior.

Pol flinched as the muscled mutant grasped the sword handle and lifted it from Pol's hands. Pol had been the sword bearer on too many execution days. He knew the ritual. He remained as he was, with his hands held up, ready to receive the sword once the executioner was finished his task.

Rastus was visibly straining against invisible bonds that held him down on the block. Pol could see the sinews in his neck and his face was red with the effort. Rastus had never been a passive leader, rising from the ranks of the Holy Guards. He was known as a fighter. He was fighting now, but to no effect.

Without a pause and without any chance to repent, the sword flashed and Rastus' head rolled on the flagstones of the courtyard. Normally, with the massive replica of the bowl, the blood that pumped from the victim was collected neatly. But Rastus' heart pumped his lifeblood out into an expanding pool. Unbidden, the thought occurred to Pol that Rastus had been lucky. Often the execution by sword required more than one blow to sever the head. This had been a single killing blow. The muscles on this Punisher were not only for show.

Pol kept his hands raised as the Punisher placed the sword on them. His right palm felt the warm stickiness of blood on the blade. This was also something that Pol had experienced many times before. The Punisher stepped back, resuming his position of attention.

Now lifeless, Rastus' body rose and moved through the air to a position of repose on the flagstones. His head also lifted from the pool of blood and was placed in a dignified position at the severed neck.

"The next accused," Melior began.

One by one, each of the assembled priests were brought forward against their will. Melior seemed to know a surprising amount about each of them, identifying them and their position in the Order. Each was given no opportunity to defend themselves against the charges. The librarian who had sent Pol to the bell tower was convicted due to his and his predecessors' ineffectiveness in preserving the truth about Melior and his plans. The loss of information had meant that what had once been the clear instructions of Melior was now only legend, superstition and regurgitation of the Words. Perhaps the librarian had sympathy for that point of view, because he struggled less than the others.

Soon, a long line of nine robed bodies lay in the square. Blood dripped from Sicaria's sword, that Pol held high above his head. He could not hold it steady. It was not the deaths of the priests, he was ashamed to admit. It was a deep fear that he would be next. All the priests that he had followed out of the Temple gates and into the square were lying on the cold ground. Their blood painted the chopping block and dripped down Pol's arms. Even Tulan, the old gardener, his bearded head lay with the rest. The only person from the Order who still stood was himself. His bowels were water.

Melior addressed the crowd again. "I have come to reclaim that which is mine. The Order as it was is no more. From today, I will be charting a new path."

The sword lifted from Pol's hands and flew to the waiting hand of Sicaria. She gave a toothy grin and her eyes fixed on Pol's. Pol almost cried out when the sword rose and blackness tinged the edges of his sight as his head swam with relief.

"There will be many opportunities to serve Me," said Melior. "Just as this boy has today. Go now. Return to your homes and your places of business. Think on what you have seen today. Think about how best to serve Me. The Trinity has returned. You will be grateful and in time we all will be the leaders of a planet remade."

There was a wave through the crowd as the still-kneeling masses bowed deeply. Pol, still standing after being relieved of the sword, fell to his knees and bowed so that his forehead was in the dirt. He felt the Trinity pass him and walk through the doors of the Temple.

"How long did it take?" asked Nessa. She was sitting with her back to the plinth. The Artifact was above her, in its otherworldly glow.

"How long did what take?" asked Jerin. He had been to the door, and listening for sounds outside. He had heard the monotonous sound of the acolytes being led in the recitation of the Words. The Hallows were still occupied.

"Until you saw… the things. The thread things. I don't see anything yet." Jerin glanced up at the Artifact, the heart of the strands that filled this room in a crazy spiderweb of them.

"I didn't really see them at first. It was a couple of days. But it was more of a feeling than seeing. I just started to feel the strange sensation that I knew were Pol was all the time. Wasn't until later that I really could see them. A few days, anyways." Nessa sighed and hugged her knees.

"At least that would be more entertaining than just sitting here," she grumbled. Jerin's brain immediately wanted to suggest kissing again, but he held his tongue.

"I could give you my robe. You could try to blend in and get out." It wasn't the first time he had suggested it.

"And then you'd be left naked in the Artifact chamber. Almost as hard to explain as being trapped in here with a girl."

"Almost," Jerin agreed, a smile on his lips.

"So what have you learned to do with these thread things? I've seen you fly. You can attach them to parts of your friends. What else?"

"It was more 'swinging' than flying," Jerin argued. "Like grabbing a rope and not falling. That's hardly flying."

"Whatever. What else?"

Jerin tried to think. Other than just snagging them, he'd never done much.

"Not a lot. I don't know how I attached this." He raised his hand and watched the line between it and… he hastily lowered his hand. He felt a rush of blood to his face and a discomfort in his loins. He quickly changed tactics. "The ones that are there. The ones that come through. Imagine a taut rope. It's a straight line—"

"Not really," Nessa interrupted. "It will sag a bit."

"Yeah, I know. I'm trying to describe it."

"But there's no sag in these things, right?" asked Nessa.

"No, not that I've seen. They are dead straight. When I snag one of them, it's like the line starts to bend, like a bowstring, but that's more of a feeling. It's barely a bend. It's more of a building energy. And when I let it go, the energy snaps."

"Like a bowstring. Okay, I can picture it." Nessa had closed her eyes. "This one you attached to me, it's like that?"

"Sort of. But imagine thinner. But that's not right, because even though I can see where they are, it's not like one's a rope and another's a thread. But that's close. The one connecting you is a thread. You couldn't swing from it." Nessa's eyes opened and her face split in a huge grin. Her hand went to her breast protectively.

"I don't even want to think about you trying!" she exclaimed. Her eyes went wide when she realized how loudly she had said it. For several heartbeats, they listened for any sign that the chanted prayers out in the Hallows had stopped. After a pause they relaxed.

"So I haven't really done anything else," Jerin admitted. "Just the snagging and snapping. Could catapult things. I just could always tell where Pol was." Jerin focused for a second and thought about it. "He's up near the entrance hall right now. I guess he's got chores there." He frowned when he thought about the acolytes out in the Hallows. Pol wasn't out there with the rest. He didn't know what that meant. Pol was moving now, further into the Temple.

"But the Artifact seems to run on them," said Nessa. "There are lots of them all tangled in it, you said."

"This whole room is a tangle," said Jerin. "You know the trapdoor spider? How it lines its burrow with silk and has trip lines running everywhere? That's what this room is. The Artifact is the center of it all, like the spider." He looked around at the room again. "I don't know what all of it does. But I'd put a wager on the lights in the room being part of it. As weird as that sounds."

"It's nothing like a bowstring," Nessa agreed. "When I start to see them, we're going to have to figure out what they're for, you know. I can't believe you've had them all this time and haven't done anything with them."

"Hey, until I came down here today, I had no idea that there was anything more."

"Is it just me, or has it suddenly gotten very quiet out there?" asked Nessa, her voice no more than a whisper.

Jerin jerked at her words, shocked that he hadn't noticed. But she was right: there was dead silence from outside the chamber. He stood staring dumbly at the door out to the Hallows for a moment, then dove to join Nessa behind the stone plinth. He sat down next to her. Instantly, Nessa clung to him.

They both heard the sound of the door opening. The door opened easily, but the sound was clear in the silence. Jerin's heartbeat was loud in his ears. He tried to make his breathing as quiet as possible.

A deep voice spoke. Jerin tried to hear what it said, but it was in an odd language. It sounded familiar, but he could not understand it. The words echoed around the chamber and died away.

There were footsteps of boots on the hard floor of the chamber. They did not hurry. There were two pairs, if Jerin could judge. There also were swishes of fabric as though long robes swept the floor.

Nessa's arms hugged Jerin tightly, and her head rested against his chest. Jerin had no idea who had come into the chamber, but his only hope was that whoever it was would not come around the plinth. The strange language puzzled him.

The voice spoke again. It was unintelligible, but this time there was an answering grunt from what sounded like a woman's voice. Pol was one of the best of the acolytes at speaking and writing in the ancient tongue, but Jerin wasn't bad. Many of the oldest books were in it, and some of the incantations of the priests were in it as well. The acolytes were supposed to learn it, but most just learned the incantations by rote. This language was like that, but not the same.

*They are climbing the plinth,* Jerin thought. There were sounds of scraping that made Jerin think of the rough, steep steps that led upwards. Without moving quickly, he tried to make himself as small as he could against the base of the stone. Nessa raised her head. Soon both of them were staring upwards to where the Artifact was, fearing to see anything. If a priest was up there and looked down, they would be caught. Jerin cursed his bright white robe. It would be seen immediately. Nessa's brown dress would have a chance of blending in.

Jerin felt movement. Nessa's hand slid in between the folds of his acolyte robe. In a moment, her hand gripped his penis.

Jerin bit his lip to stay silent from the shock. But he didn't look down. He still looked up to where the sounds now emanated.

The low voice spoke again. It sounded like a question. The woman did not reply, and silence fell. Jerin held his breath.

The fibers that radiated from the Artifact through the stone plinth started to change. Some dissipated. Others seemed to unravel. Others snapped out to attach themselves to other parts of the chamber. Jerin's eyes followed it all, not understanding what he was seeing. The deep voice spoke again but again there was no answer and the changes to the threads did not stop.

Jerin froze as he saw a hand. It was on the edge of the bowl, which was just visible above. The hand came from a dark colored sleeve. The hand ran along the edge of the bowl, and Jerin watched as the threads that anchored it went away.

There was a grating sound. The small part of the bowl that Jerin could see moved. Jerin could not believe his eyes. As far as he knew, the Artifact had been here in this place since the Apocalypse. The Temple itself had grown around this place and the Artifact within. He had thought that the bowl itself was fused to the rock of the plinth. But the bowl moved, and then he could not see it any more.

Except that he could. Just like he could see the large threads approaching through the walls of the Temple, he was surprised to see that he could "see" the tangle of threads surrounding the Artifact through the stone. It was moving slowly, majestically, away from its usual place and down. There were four of the threads that seemed to be suspending the bowl as it moved, but they were harder to make out.

There were a few sounds of movement from above, but they followed the Artifact as it descended and crossed the floor to the exit. In a few short moments, Jerin and Nessa were alone again, this time in an Artifact chamber without an Artifact.

Nessa withdrew her hand and shot Jerin an almost apologetic smile.

## Out of the Frying Pan

Minutes after the Artifact was taken from the chamber, the Hallows were empty. Jerin went out first to make sure that the room was empty, and to his surprise it was. As unexpectedly as the Hallows had filled, it was empty again. He and Nessa took the first unused passage that they knew of and in minutes they were standing in the laundry, facing each other. Jerin didn't want her to leave, but to have her stay even a minute longer seemed to be tempting fate.

They had gone through such an intense experience together. It felt like he should say something or do something, but he didn't know what it was. Nessa was looking at him, her neck tilted just a little because he was a bit taller. There was a long silence. Daring to do what he thought he might never, Jerin stepped close to her. She watched him the whole time, with her dark eyes seeming to hold secrets that only she knew. He bent his head down and she tilted hers up to meet him. Their lips came together in a long kiss that did not end.

Instead of ending, it deepened. Lips parted and tongues explored each other. Jerin felt his hands were moving of their own volition. Nessa's seemingly were everywhere, touching him and rubbing him in a way that felt like it would cause him to explode with pleasure. Nessa broke away. Her eyes were shining and her lips were swollen.

"I will see you again, soon," she said. She was out of breath. "I will wait for some effect." When Jerin didn't understand, she added, "From the Artifact. You know, the reason we were down in the chamber?" She teased him, and Jerin felt himself blush. He was still lost in the passionate kiss. The reminder was enough for him to start thinking about what trouble he might be in. He didn't know exactly what time it was, but his empty stomach said that he had missed lunch and certainly the start of chores.

"I'm going to have to come up with some excuse," he muttered, thinking of how difficult Q'docet had been lately. But then he smiled and leaned in and got a quick peck on the lips from Nessa. "Totally worth it, though," he grinned. He watched Nessa slide down the chute to the alley outside the Temple before starting to navigate through the Temple, trying to figure out where he should be.

When he finally saw the light outside, he was surprised to find it wasn't as late as he feared. In the western windows, the sun was still well above the  rim of the City wall. it was past mid-afternoon, but definitely not dinner time yet. Chore time wasn't over yet. He would have to find his work crew and then come up with some excuse. He would claim he had been sick. Something he had eaten at lunch.

But it was difficult to find anyone. The Temple corridors were deserted. There should have been acolytes running here and there, performing the chores they'd been assigned. The lamps were unattended, and the few that were lit were guttering, low on oil. Even the lavatories, usually a trap for those who merited the worst chores, were deserted. The mess was an echoing empty room, with signs of a half-eaten meal at every spot in the long tables.

Hungry, Jerin helped himself to an untouched roll from one of the acolyte's forgotten plates. The gravy from the roast was congealed, with white globs of fat on top. He thought of the sudden influx of people in the Hallows and wondered what had happened. Whatever it had been, it had interrupted the lunch meal.

He chewed on the roll, thinking about where to go next. The line that ran from him to Pol gave him his next place to explore. It might have seemed like the Temple was empty, but Jerin knew exactly where Pol was. And that line was pointed in the direction of the dorms. That was a logical spot. Maybe it wasn't usual for this time of day, it made more sense than anything else that had happened in the last few hours. Jerin saw the back of one white robe disappearing at the end of a hall as he walked along the corridors and climbed the flight of stairs up to the dorm level. At least the Temple wasn't completely deserted.

The doors to the dorm that Rank Twelve shared with Rank Eleven were closed. There were no sounds to be heard when Jerin put his ear to the door, but the line that always pointed to Pol pointed unerringly through and into the room beyond. Jerin took a breath and then turned the latch and pushed the doors. The long room with its high windows was full. He quickly spotted every boy who lived here. They were standing or sitting around in small knots of friends. The voices were all whispers, but they cut off immediately when Jerin opened the door. Wide, frightened eyes were in the faces of every boy. Every boy jumped when they heard the door open and even when they recognized the blond acolyte, they did not relax. Jerin had not expected a welcome, but he was confused by the reaction. No voice called out to ask him where he'd been. No one accused him of shirking from chores. even Hume did not take the opportunity to make some sort of insulting remark while everyone was staring at Jerin.

Then Jerin saw Pol. He was a small figure, alone, sitting on his bunk at the far end of the room. Pol's back was to the door, and of all the boys, he was the only one who did not turn to see who had entered. Jerin pushed the door closed again. He started working his way down the long room towards his friend. He wove through the groups of acolytes. Again, he was surprised that none of them 'accidentally' got in his way or stuck out a foot to trip him. They watched silently as Jerin passed.

Whispered conversations resumed. Jerin caught a few words here and there. "Melior" and "dead" and "Trinity" were said in hushed tones. Jerin did not pay much attention. He was focused on his friend.

"Pol?" he asked quietly when he reached their bunk. Pol was sitting on his lower bunk, his shoulders hunched. Jerin saw that there were dark brown stains on the sleeves of Pol's white acolyte robe. "Pol, what's the matter?" Pol didn't respond, and that was when Jerin caught a faint scent of urine. "Pol, talk to me," Jerin said. He reached out and shook Pol's shoulder. His friend's face turned toward him. His eyes were haunted. There were dark brown splashes on his cheeks and forehead, and some were smeared where tears had been running down. It took Jerin a moment to recognize what was all over his friend.

"Pol, why are you covered in blood?" It was splashed on the front of his robes. Jerin had been the sword bearer for executions. He recognized the stains, even if he had never seen so many before. "Pol, who died?"

"All of them," Pol whispered. His shoulders started to shake and new tears began to spill from his eyes. Jerin looked around at the other boys in the room, and he saw sympathy on their faces but no one spoke up.

"What happened to him?" Jerin asked. The boys looked at each other, and there were shrugs. The boys in the closest group were from the Eleventh.

The tallest one, Fergal, spoke up. "Dunno. When the bells started ringing, the priests herded us down into the Hallows. Didn't see much there. Then that really tall man in the dark robes and the woman came down."

"A woman. Can you believe it? And they carried off the Artifact!" The boy at Fergal's elbow, Jonah, interjected. He said it in a whisper, but it was excited.

"Yes, I was getting to that. He was here," Fergal waved at Pol, "when we got back. The priests all were going to the Grand Hall. Sent us to the dorms."

"Why?" asked Jerin.

"They're all dead," said Pol.

"Who's dead, Pol?" asked Jerin. None of this was making any sense. Pol didn't answer.

"That's what he said," said Fergal, stuffing his hands into the pockets of his robe. "Said something about the Trinity, but he's not making much sense."

"Didn't the priests help him? Q'docet?"

"Like I said. They are in the Hall. Not much time for us," said Fergal.

"Come on, Pol," said Jerin. He bent down and put Pol's arm over his shoulder and raised him to his feet. He had to stoop because his friend was short, but together, he and Pol made it down to the doors again.

"You can't go out!" someone shouted, but Jerin ignored it and dragged Pol out and down the hall to the lavatory. There, he got a fire under the copper and started cleaning his friend up. It took a while, but eventually there was enough hot water to fill a tub and Jerin stripped Pol down and helped him in. The water was steaming, but Pol began shaking like he was freezing to death. Jerin sat with his friend until the shaking stopped. After that came more tears. There were words in the sobs, but Jerin couldn't make them out.

When the tears were done, Jerin left Pol with the soap and took his robes away and to the laundry. He gave them a sniff. It *was* urine. *Something had scared Pol that badly*? And the metallic smell of blood. By the time he had scrubbed the clothes clean and left them to dry, Pol was out of the tub and sitting with a towel wrapped around himself. He looked up hopefully when Jerin entered the bath and had such a sad, happy face when he saw who it was that it made Jerin hurt for his friend all over again.

"Pol, what... what can you tell me?" He didn't want to press and cause Pol to lose control again. Pol seemed to have regained some of his balance, but his voice was low and rough from the earlier tears.

"Jerin, I don't know what I saw. I don't know if it's real. Hope it isn't..." He began to tell Jerin about what had happened. It was all out of order and he stopped and started new thoughts without warning. It was so unlike Pol, who was the most gifted speaker among the acolytes. Jerin caught the importance of the hole in the sky, and the descent to the city of three figures. Pol's words echoed around the tiled surfaces of the bath, punctuated from time to time by a drip.

"Tulan?" Jerin said disbelievingly. Pol nodded. It was hard to imagine the old gardener being gone. It was even harder to fathom that Melior would want him to be dead. The old man had always skirted the line of being cast out of the Order with his strange opinions. Jerin had thought that the man spent so much time alone because if he hadn't, the Highest would have ejected him long since.

Thinking about that, he tried to rectify the Words and the actions of a deity that might have just fallen to Earth.

"Why him?" he asked.

"He was in the wrong place at the wrong time," said Pol. His voice spoke of the loss, even though he did not know Tulan nearly as well as Jerin. "The leadership of the Order. They were all there. And Tulan. And the librarian."

"Is he going to kill all the priests?" Jerin shocked himself with the idea.

"I thought he was going to kill me." There was not a trace of humor in Pol's voice. He was dead serious.

"But he didn't."

"Right. But he did kill all the priests who were there. Fergal said that all of the priests were called to the Grand Hall…" Pol's face went white.

"What should we do?" his voice was small. Jerin had no answer. They were only two acolytes. They could do nothing. Whatever was happening in the Hall at the moment, they would have to wait until it was done.

Jerin left Pol in the bathing room, returning the short way to the dorm to get him a new robe. No one was allowed to roam the halls wrapped in a towel for any reason. Nothing was changed in the dorm. Everyone was still there. There was no news of any kind and no one had dared to leave the room except for Jerin and Pol. The boys looked surprised to see Jerin back. A couple asked after Pol and Jerin told them that he would be okay. He and Pol might not have been the most popular boys in the Rank, but they cared enough to ask.

Jerin pulled Fergal aside.

"Ferg, did the… who brought you here and told you to stay here?"

"Q'sammal, and Q'docet, of course. Brought us up from the Hallows. Why?"

"Did they seem okay to you?"

"Jerin, they were messed up. We think that was Melior. *Melior*. And they took the Artifact. Q'sammal  looked like the rest of us." He gestured to the rest of the boys in the dorm. "Why?"

Jerin shrugged. "Just… I missed it. I wish I'd seen something at least. I wish I could hear what was going on in the Hall."

Fergal's eyes narrowed. "Yeah, about that. Where were you?"

"Sick. Was feeling bad," Jerin said absently. He didn't think that Fergal bought it, but he didn't care. If he was reported to a priest for skipping chores, it would be the least significant event of the day. At this point, he would be glad to see that Q'docet was okay. He pulled a clean robe from Pol's locker and retraced his steps to where his friend was waiting.

Jerin was thinking as Pol put on his robe. "Do you think…" Jerin began, but he didn't want to voice it aloud. He brought his voice down to the softest whisper he could. "Do you think he's really… you know."

"Really what?" Pol was tying the intricate knot that the sash required.

"Really… you know… Him."

Pol's eyes searched out Jerin's. There was a moment of incomprehension, and then he looked nervously around the bathing room.

"You mean… is he really Him? Melior? Jerin, you can't ask that."

"I don't know. I didn't see much of anything. I just have trouble… he killed Tulan, Pol. Tulan. Probably just to make a point. To send a message." For the first time since he had exited the Artifact chamber, Jerin was feeling anger. His fists clenched as he spoke.

"Jer, he flew out of a hole in the sky. He made things fly."

"Fergal said that he took the Artifact from the room behind the Hallows."

"Him and Sicaria," corrected Pol. Jerin had heard a woman's voice in the chamber. So that had been Sicaria. The person claiming to be Melior had taken the Artifact. He had watched that happen. He had seen the fibers that were connecting the Artifact to the plinth being removed and changed by whoever was doing it. That implied…

"Pol, I've made things fly. Including myself."

"Chucking eggs over the city wall is not the same thing." Pol looked indignant.

"But what if egg-chucking is just the first step? Then other things might be possible. Pol, I just don't know. I've never really tried. I saw them doing things with these invisible threads."

Pol just looked at Jerin.

"Pol, I was in the Artifact chamber when Melior went in there." Pol's eyes went wide at that. The words to ask why started forming on Pol's lips, but Jerin watched the wheels turning as Pol figured it out.

"You were in there? With her?" he whispered the last. "Why in the name of…?"

It was Jerin's turn to tell Pol what had happened, including Nessa bleeding into the bowl.

"But the Artifact, Pol, the Artifact. It was… like nothing I've ever seen. Just a thicket of those threads. I couldn't see them when you and I went in there. But now… it's like the Artifact is… is… a machine. The bowl and the sphere are just what you can see. There was so much more to it. Without the blood, it didn't work, but then with it, it did it."

"Did what?"

"It worked, I think."

"Like on you? She can see things too?"

Jerin looked away. "Well, we don't know yet. Remember, it took me a while. She got knocked out like me."

"Jerin, you fell over and hit your head. I was there. I hauled you to the medic."

They argued for a minute about that, but Jerin brought it to an end.

"I saw what I saw, Pol. Whether I was there with Nessa or not is not the important part. I saw them changing those fibers. Moving them. Getting rid of them. They did it in order to free the Artifact from the stone holding it, I think."

"What does that matter?" asked Pol.

"It matters, Pol. The only think we have that links the Order physically to the Trinity is what? The Artifact. And I figured out that it's some kind of machine. A machine that makes people be able to… do things. Things that are difficult to explain. And then people show up who claim to be gods, do things that can't be explained and then they take the Artifact, showing that they can do these things with these threads. What if…" Jerin swallowed. "What if they are like me?"

There was a silence as both boys grappled with what Jerin had said.

"Are you implying that the second coming of our God is… what? A fake?" Pol was looking at Jerin with wide eyes.

"What? No, I don't know. I'm just saying that…" Jerin struggled for words. His brain was having trouble processing everything that he had been told.

"I like you, Jerin," Pol said with a grin. "You spend your whole life training to be a priest in the Order. An Order that preaches that Melior will return one day. And when he comes, you immediately doubt it. No wonder you'll never get raised."

"It sounds bad, doesn't it?"

"Yeah, but what if you're right?"

## It Worked

The streets were eerily quiet as Nessa made her way from the Temple. She didn't notice until she was halfway back to the home her family had above their shop. Half of the shops along the way were closed, and the rest were quiet and no one was there hawking or perusing the wares. She was floating along, still reliving the kiss with Jerin and the experience in the Artifact chamber. She gave a giggle remembering how they had been hiding as someone had come into the room. They could have been found. But they hadn't been.

It was like that time, so long ago, when she and Jerin had been found in the Temple. Nessa hitched her dress, feeling the fabric catching on the roughness that was the scarring on her back. That night they had been caught. Today, they hadn't. It was a victory. Almost her whole life, the Temple had contained the things she wanted most. She wouldn't let fear keep her out.

As it slowly dawned on her that the streets were strangely empty, her pace picked up.

She ran by the closed shop front and down the alley to the narrow stair that led up to the living space above the shop. She burst in the door, fearing what she might find. Her family was there, all stitting around the table. Her mother and sisters gave screams as the door flew open.

"Where have you been?" yelled her father, rising from the table, relief on his face. He rushed to Nessa and engulfed her in a hug.

"What has happened?" Nessa managed to ask from her father's squeezing. She didn't believe what she was hearing as her father told her. She had missed a lot.

"What happens now?" she asked. There was no answer from either of her parents. She couldn't see the Temple out of any of the windows, but she worried About Jerin being in that place with... who? The gods that they had preached About for millenia?

Levifid stared at Sicaria. She stared back. They were seated in the outer room of the chambers that the Order had prepared for Melior on short notice. Levifid suspected that they were those vacated by the recently deceased head of the Order. They were comfortable enough, but there was no dominus-sized furniture to be had. Craftsmen in the city were hard at work trying to fix that, but at the moment only some hastily made beds and three chairs in the Grand Hall were available. These softly-upholstered seats were comfortable enough, but Levifid could not get his legs comfortable. Either his feet were flat on the floor and his knees were jutting up above his hips, or he stretched his legs out. Neither position was dignified. But if he got up, he would pace and that would be even less dignified.

They were waiting for Melior. Today, he would speak to the assembled Order, putting his plans into place. The meeting was to start at the first chime after sunrise, which would be soon. Levifid checked his internal sense of tine, and expected the chime in just over seventeen minutes. He and Sicaria were dressed in their dominus robes, all sinister darks, cut to try to accentuate the otherworldliness of the dominus frame. Sicaria, whose body was not the long dominus form, wore hers but the effect was entirely different. Especially when she insisted on wearing them in ways that hinted at sexuality. She was sitting perfectly conformably in the seat across from Levifid. Her eyes, irises a blood red, were on Levifid, and a slight smile curved the corners of her mouth. Her hair, long and black, cascaded down and around her shoulders. It blended in with the dark robes, which kept flowing down.

The neckline of the robes, tight to the throat on his, was loose on hers, plunging down between her breasts. The narrow sliver of skin was all the more shocking for the severity of its surroundings. She was not a large woman, in any way. She was not tall like a dominus, having the same human frame that she had had back in happier days on Earth. If anything, some of the extra flesh had been stripped from her in the years since they had been awakened on Tero. But no matter how much her face and body reminded him of Thera, the woman he loved, he knew that she was Sicaria. He no longer hoped that somehow Thera had survived the trauma that the original Sicaria had done on her mind. She was now a chaotic element, harnessed when possible by Melior. Levifid could only try to reduce the harm that she caused. Now that the Trinity were back and with the Order to support Melior, Levifid wondered how effective he could be.

Her sultry smile and her suggestive cleavage only made him weep unshed tears for what he had lost, and what the people of Tero would lose shortly. Melior came out of his chambers, and Levifid broke his eye contact with Sicaria. It was an excuse to stand, out of this undersized chair. If Melior took it as a sign of respect, let him think that. Melior was dressed as they were, in the official robes of the dominus, but with a green and yellow ribbon across his shoulders and spilling down his chest.

"Nearly time," he said. It was said without excitement, but Levifid suspected that the older dominus was looking forward to this.

"The Hall will not hold all of the Order and the acolytes," said Levifid. "I have instructed the priests to leave the youngest. It seemed the best option."

"Unfortunate," said Melior, checking his cuffs. "I suspected as much though. No larger room exists in all of Arnath, though." He made a clicking sound with his tongue. "I wonder if there is any way that we could get them to change that name. Victoria I like, but to have the nation named after Reas' town is annoying."

"I don't think that the significance of the name is known," said Levifid.

"Odd that some things should have survived the long years, while others did not."

"Yes. It seems almost random. The efforts of individuals in the chaos that seems to have reigned after Reas' last act of defiance." Levifid didn't like to bring that up. It reminded Melior over again, of the time that had been lost waiting for the radiation to dissipate. An irate Melior was one who would do terrible things. "The Words survived, and some stories of before, but it seems as though the people are entirely unaware of their arrival on this planet. Seems an odd thing to forget."

"Not everyone has forgotten," said Melior. In the weeks that they had spent preparing for their arrival in Victoria, Melior had sent Shade south, to what had been the Red Zone when the *Compass Rose* had crashed. She—Levifid still thought of the Shade as a woman, even if there was no physical evidence of it any longer—had been tasked with gaining an understanding of the people who lived there and to report back. She had been able to move freely at night with her spectral form.

What she had learned had put Melior into a rage. Levifid suspected that the bloodletting yesterday in the courtyard was largely in reaction to what he had learned. The Red Zone, or Rhed as it was now called, was thriving. Shade had no frame of reference for some of the things she had seen, having been one of the poorest people living in the fringes of Arnath, but the things she described sounded much more advanced than was here. Paved roads, what sounded like steam power and even electricity had left Shade without the words to describe them, but Melior and Levifid had gotten the picture.

The Order had prohibited trade of any sort with the south. In the ancient past, the native jungle of Tero had kept the Red Zone apart from the Yellow and Green in the north, but now the Order kept than apart. There were forthouses along the border, interdicting any travel north or south. And reports were that the Rhedmen enforced the same on their side of the border.

Levifid, with so such experience as a Judicial on Earth, was morbidly curious as to how the parallel laws stopping traffic had evolved on the border. The Order's dictum he thought he understood. Here, the Order was fully in control of the population. Any disruption to that would threaten than. That was why they kept the armed foce known as the Holy Guards. Levifid had been reading what he could in the library the previous night, and it seemed that the Guardsmen had been used viciously to put down anything that might have been rebellion. In the Eastern Marches, some of the dots on the map they had been following were only burnt-out ruins. From what Levifid had learned about Arnath, he suspected the people of Rhed were right to try to cut Arnath off and ignore it. But he also suspected that Melior was not going to let than do that anymore.

The Rhedians had not had the worst of the *Compass Rose* crash, and might even have escaped the relative anarchy that had followed. There was reason to believe that they were fully aware of where they had come from. And perhaps understood the threat Melior represented.

"No, not everyone," Levifid agreed. "That appears to be a result of Geography. And politics. Something that can be changed."

"Not easily," said Melior. "And I mean for the Red Zone to forget it, not the other way around." It was a measure of Levifid's surpirse that he was speechless for a moment.

"Yes, that would be difficult. It's very difficult to put the genie back in the bottle, as it were."

"Well, I don't know all of what has happened in this so-called Rhed. But I have time, and I don't have any opposition this time. Bloody Reas. Reas the Damned. That's only the half of it. I hope Satan's been stabbing him with a pitchfork all this time." He looked appraisingly at Sicaria. "It is nearly time to go. You each know your parts?" Sicaria gave a curt nod and then a smile that was all teeth. Levifid also contented himself with a nod. It's not like it was difficult to sit down and be quiet. "Then we will go. The bell will ring before we get there." Levifid rose and allowed Melior to and Sicaria to precede him out of the rooms. Punisher and Death were in the hall, waiting for them to emerge and keeping away any unwanted visitors.

Punisher was an obvious threat to anyone who met him. Almost as tall as the domini, he was half again as wide and always seemingly on the edge of violence. The display yesterday in the courtyard left there no doubt that he would willingly terminate any opposition to the Trinity. Death was a different kind of threat, and one that preyed on the superstitions that these people seemed to have developed in the time since the wreck of the *Compass Rose*. The fear of the skeletal face, half-hidden by the deep cowl touched on a memory of the servants in Trinity House so long ago, even if the facts of the matter had been lost. There were plenty of stories of ghosts and phantasms in this modern Arnath, and no science to dispel them. Despite his being able to see how it was done, Death still gave Levifid the creeps. They navigated the corridors of the Temple, with Punisher leading and Death following.

The place was built like a rabbit warren. So many different constructions, building and re-adding to the original structure left there no straight routes. Levifid made a note to ask for a map of the Temple. He knew only a few routes and he suspected that Melior would not take it well if Levifid the wise councillor got a reputation for getting lost.

The sound of the distant bell rang as the procession of five turned the last corner before the Hall. Two Guards stood at the large, heavy double doors. Each was armed with what would be a halberd back on Earth, crossed to bar entrance. They immediately uncrossed the weapons and each took hold of one latch and pulled the doors open, wide, offering no resistance. Punisher and Death stopped just inside the doors, and the Trinity moved forward along the central axis of the Hall. The room was easily the biggest space in the City and by extension, Arrath. A semi-circular table stood at the far end. At it, along the outside of the semicircle, were the chairs that the Order Council sat at when deliberating. The centre chair was the tallest-backed, until yesterday it was where the Highest had sat. All but three chairs had been removed.

There were ranks of benches on both sides of the center of the Hall, stepping up. They were half-full with the collected priesthood of the Order. There were others who were out, performing tasks on behalf of the Order, but anyone who was in the City or in the surrounding lands had been called today. The eldest of the acolytes sat in the first rank of benches, although today they were towards the back. Above and on three sides of the room, the balconies were full. Acolytes of all ages over seven were in attendance, a sea of white.

Whispered conversations died as the Trinity entered the room. Absolute silence took the crowd, hundreds of pairs of eyes on the three of them. Sicaria stepped at Melior's right shoulder, one pace back, and Levifid took his mirrored position on the left. When they reached the Council table, Sicaria and he took their seats to either side of the tallest one. Melior stood at his seat but did not take it for a minute. He looked out at the gathered Order, his face impassive but his eyes judging and looking for flaws. Levifid could see faces flinch as Melior's gaze swept over them. When he took his seat, so did the assembled Order.

Melior began his prepared speech, and Levifid tuned it out, listening with a small fraction of his dominus intellect. That left the majority of his mind free to think about what Melior had said in private. It always paid to think carefully about the things that he said, as they gave hints of plans that might need to be resisted or at least softened. Tero was a different place than when they had been entombed under molten bedrock and irradiated wreckage. Levifid knew very little of the Red Zone today, but it sounded like it was more populous and prosperous than Arnath.

The total population was likely in the millions now. From the tens of thousands who had landed, a robust human population was living on this planet. One of the key things Levifid had wanted to avoid before was the inadvertent extinction of the colonists. Much had been fragile back then: the seeders that were beating back the hostile native biomes, the small number of total humans, the success or failure of harvests. These were all existential threats to the colony. Now, there were fewer of those.

And yet Melior could wipe out the entirety of Rhed if he so chose. On Earth, huge areas of multiple continents were sheets of glass where the wars of the Second Generation had been fought. One firestorm for each city in Rhed and there would be only survivors clinging to life. That was one possible way that Melior could get the Red Zone to forget its history. But it wasn't Melior's style. He would eliminate opposition without concern, but genocide wasn't something that Levifid suspected him capable of.

Melior was describing how the Order would be re-formed with the express purpose of extending control over all of Arnath. Levifid was about to start thinking about Melior's probable courses of action again when he noticed two acolytes in the first rank. They were not looking in the direction of the Trinity, but that was not what caught Levifid's attention.

"I'm telling you, they are absolutely covered with these thread things," Jerin whispered directly in Pol's ear. It wasn't an argument. It was just that Jerin could see something that Pol couldn't. He didn't dare whisper anything more in the quiet of the Hall. He could barely pull his eyes away from what he was seeing. It was the first time that he had seen any of the Five. Until now, it had only been Pol's descriptions of them. No matter how gifted Pol was with language, he had fallen short when describing them to Jerin.

The one that they called the Punisher was a brute. Jerin's eyes could see his muscular exterior, but it was what was inside that was fascinating. Lines traced out the man's skeleton almost like Jerin was able to see inside him. Every bone, every joint was outlined for him to see. Each muscle and tendon was the same. As he moved, the lines moved with him. They were attached to this man's structure. Jerin suspected that this Punisher would be very hard to injure, let alone kill.

Death was something else entirely. All of the fibers inside Punisher were structural, but Death was enveloped in loops and strands that extended out from his body. The way that these connected made no sense at all to Jerin. It was almost as though they were able to hide what was inside. With his eyes, Jerin saw a skeletal being, floating about half a meter above the floor with no evidence of legs. But when he concentrated on understanding the fibers that enveloped the figure, he could see that Wraith was actually a man. A man that was floating above the floor, but still a man. Death was an illusion. Something that had been crafted using these powers that Jerin had. He obviously knew almost nothing about what was possible.

When he thought about what Nessa had said, he felt embarrassed. He had had these gifts for a couple of years now, and done almost nothing. If Death was an illusion, then that reinforced Jerin's fear that these beings who had fallen from the sky, claiming to be the gods from ancient history were also an illusion. But when Jerin looked at the supposed Trinity, he saw none of the trickery that was visible in Punisher and Death.

The long, tall forms of Melior and Levifid were not an illusion. They were the shapes they were. There was no evidence in any of the three that his eyes were being fooled or that they were exerting effort to be something that they were not. There were countless likenesses of Melior and the Trinity around the Temple and in the books in the Library. When Jerin looked at each of them, he supposed they could be the ones who were being depicted. That Sicaria was short was not part of anything Jerin had seen, but artists brushed over phyicial details all the time. Melior was much like his likenesses, but where were the eyes of fire? Levifid was much younger looking than most of the pictures Jerin had seen. They depicted a man who was old, where this Levifid was still the picture of youth. Jerin guessed he was less than thirty years old. If these were charlatans, then why hadn't they done the basic research to know what the Trinity looked like?

Levifid sensed that Sicaria had seen it too. Out of the corner of his right eye, he could see her shifting in her seat. She was trying to obey Melior's instructions to sit still while he spoke to the Order, but Levifid could tell that it was only a matter of time before she would be unable to comply. The closer of the two acolytes had a dark fiber attached to him. And it was harder to see, but Levifid thought that there might be one that attached the two boys as well. That one of the acolytes should have a dark fiber attached to him was almost impossible to explain. That there should be two was astronomically impossible. Unless...

Unless he had been affected by the Artifact. Again, that was wrong on so many levels. Even if the Order had institutional memory of how to operate the bowl and sphere, it was only the priests who would be bled into it and changed by the mechanism that Sicaria had devised. If Levifid understood the rules and laws of the modern Order, there would be no circumstances where an acolyte could be have access to it.

That the Order had failed to remember how to operate the bowl was something that Levifid found privately hilarious. How many children over how many centuries had been bled into the bowl for no other reason than that the ceremony demanded it? How many times had the bowl been activated by the bleeding person's DNA, only to go quiet later when no one had taken the vital step of putting part of their body into the space beneath the sphere? The forgetting must have happened not long after the wreck of the *Compass Rose*, because there was not even a trace of recognition in the priests' faces when he had interrogated them on the matter. Levifid itched to go and access the library. There were probably some answers in there that the priests had no recollection of.

It made little difference now. Mellor had taken the Artifact away and secreted it somewhere that Levifid didn't know. It had served its purpose, even if not in the way that had been originally intended. The boy with the fibers pointing him out like two giant arrows for any dominus to read was also notable for the color of his hair. The other boys and all of the priests were dark of hair, as were all of the townsfolk. The genetic history of the area was another interesting aspect of the history since the Apocalypse that he would like to delve into, but he doubted he would get the opportunity. Such hair either spoke of a genetic mutation or him being from elsewhere. Further to the East was a possibility. There had been some variation in the villages near to the crash site. It was an interesting fact about the boy, to go along with the fibers.

For a moment, Levifid considered the wild possibility that the boy was a mutant, and had developed some crude control of dark fibers without any interference by Sicaria's artifact. But then he remembered how many gene patches went into forming a dominus and rejected it as more unlikely than the possibility that two cosmic dark fibers had become attached to him.

Melior was wrapping up. Levifid quickly reviewed what he had said. It didn't go as far as saying that Arnath was gearing up for war with Rhed, but Levifid hadn't expected that. It was only the day after they had removed the previous head of the Order. *Literally,* Levifid thought, then was embarrassed by making such a joke, even inside his head. But then he was proud of himself for making a joke.

The Order and the acolytes were standing, and Melior rose to depart the Hall. Sicaria leaped to her feet, her hands flexing with impatience. Levifid was worried that she would do something to the boy. He kept immediately to her left at as the Trinity walked back down the central aisle of the Hall. The boy was near the back of the people gathered on the main level of the Hall, to their left. She would have to go through him in order to do anything to him. Lefifid tensed as they came abreast of the boy, and the line was reaching across the space, invisible to all but the three. Levifid noticed Melior shifting his head, noting the unexpected strand.

Sicaria pivoted. She was going to launch herself into the crowd. Levifid calmly summoned dark fibers, ensnaring her and anchoring her to her place. While unnaturally gifted in her explorations of what was possible, she was weak when compared to either Melior or himself. As long as she did not drive that sword through him in his sleep in retribution later, Levifid did not have to fear her.

Melior hissed in annoyance at Sicaria's lunge. He stopped to fix her with a stare. At first Sicaria was glaring murder at Levifid for stopping her, but she softened under Melior's gaze and relaxed long enough for Levifid to release her. Melior gave Levifid what he thought was an approving look, before his eyes glanced over at the boy in the stands. Then he was striding forward again, out of the Hall. Levifid waited until Sicaria had started moving again before following. He spared a glance for the boy. His eyes were wide and his face was as white as his robe.

*He knows,* thought Levifid. *How interesting.*

Jerin barely maintained control of his bowels. Everything had happened so quickly. If Sicaria had been permitted to, she could have easily have taken him, or killed him, or anything. *How could I be so stupid?* he asked himself. *Of course if I can see what has been done to the Five, they could see... this.* He looked at the line that extended from his left hand, out through the structure of the Temple, into the City where Nessa was. He barely thought of it, nor the one that connected him to Pol, but to these strangers, no doubt they marked him like a thousand lights

"I thought she was going to jump into the stands," said Pol, a tremor in his voice. "Why'd she stop?"

"He stopped her," said Jerin.

"Who, Melior?" asked Pol. The doors to the Hall were still open, but the Punisher and Death were gone now, and only the Guards remained. The Order was not yet leaving, confused by what the strange behaviour of the Trinity on the way out meant. The priests were looking around, trying to understand what had drawn all the attention. Jerin kept his head down.

"No, I think... I think it was Levifid,"' Jerin muttered, more to himself than to Pol. What was he supposed to do?

"I'll discuss in later," Jerin whispered to Pol when it looked like Pol was going to ask another question. Pol closed his mouth. *I'm in danger. Polls in danger.* He looked at his left fist. *Nessa's in danger.*

## Focus of Attention

Levifid wanted nothing more than to go and find the blond boy and speak to him. The more he thought of it, he thought that there must have been some event where the boy had come in contact with the Artifact and activated it. Of course without any sort of a guide, he would be able to do very little. Maybe even only do things without understanding them. But without speaking to him, there would be no knowing.

Unfortunately, he couldn't. He had been dismissed by Melior as Sicaria had, but now he had to keep an eye on her. Stopping her in the Hall had only been a temporary fix. There was no way that a being as single-minded as Sicaria would give up when she had a target. Levifid had followed her. Sicaria, her small, dark frame had led him through the halls of the Temple, never quite coming close to the acolyte's dormitories, but then never quite staying away, either.

She had stopped and whirled to face him after the slow, sedate chase had gone on for a while. Her face had been a mix of fury and amusement, as though she had been unable to decide whether Levifid's attention was anything but a game.

"Yes, I am following you," he had told her. "Unless you are willing to swear an oath to Melior that you will leave the boy alone?" She had barked a laugh at that. Then she had returned to the rooms that she had been given by the most direct route. She had stopped, half inside the door, and stared at him. This time, her face was considering. Her eyes seemed to be asking him to come inside her apartment. Perhaps promising something physical, as though that might be enough to distract him. Levifid did not feel temptation at the idea. More like a deep fear. He would be more likely to die in there than experience any pleasure.

He had bowed a good day to her, and then retreated. As he had walked away, she had chuckled and then he had heard the door closing. He hadn't gone far. By some stroke of fortune, there was a light well that Sicaria's rooms opened onto. From a position not too far away from the doors, he could watch the windows and balcony of Sicaria's apartments. A drop of a few meters meant nothing to a being who could fly. He wanted to go to the boy. But he couldn't leave Sicaria unwatched. She might choose to discover whatever lay at the other end of the fiber instead. Levifid cleared his mind and started waiting.

"What do you mean, leave?" hissed Pol. They were sitting on Jerin's bunk, from their higher vantage point somewhat separated from the rest of the boys in the dorm. Most were gathered in the common area near to the fire hearth, which was not lit. There were a dozen conversations going on, but all revolving around the Trinity and what Melior had said. Some of the boys were excited, thinking that there would be new opportunities and adventures. Others were fearful, reading into the words different, more sinister meanings. Pol and Jerin were by themselves, but they had to keep their voices down.

"I am serious Pol. We needed to be gone yesterday. What do you need to take?"

"I'm not arguing with you Jer. I've been telling you since yesterday that we need to get out of here. I just want to know what you mean." Pol's face was earnest.

"Sorry Pol. I… We are in danger." He looked around. The dorm was a place of safety, but the walls felt like they were closing in. "If Sicaria comes. I don't know why she hasn't already." He flexed his left hand. The telltale thread pointed through the dorm wall.

"You were trying to tell me. What did you see? What happened?"

"The most important thing is that they saw me. Sicaria, Melior, Levifid. All of them."

"You? Why?" asked Pol.

"This." Jerin held up his left hand, but of course Pol could not see anything. "Remember when I woke up and you came to visit me in the medic's? And I could tell where you were? I told you later that there was one of these… threads attaching us."

"Yeah, I remember. Is it still there?"

"Yes. I don't know how to remove it. I don't think about it much, but it's like a sixth sense of knowing where you are."

Pol nodded. "And they saw it? I was right next to you. How could it have been obvious?"

"Not exactly." Jerin let out a breath and stroked the rough surface of the bedclothes with his uninjured left hand. "I made another one of these… connections. A few weeks ago. It was probably as clear as day to them. I wasn't thinking."

Pol looked at Jerin through narrowed eyes.

"It wasn't another connection to me."

"No."

"It was her, wasn't it?" Jerin nodded. His face felt hot.

"By the blood of the Trinity, Jerin!" Pol struggled to keep his voice down, but still a couple of faces turned their way. Pol controlled it better, but his face was flushed with anger. "You're telling me that they are going to come and find you because you've tagged your little girlfriend. And then they'll find me because you did the same thing to me?"

"I didn't mean to!" said Jerin. "I don't even know how I did it. It just… happened."

"Wait, you said that the Trinity took these threads off when they moved the Artifact. You can do the same thing. Get this connection off me. Now." Pol looked furious. He batted at where he imagined the cord to be, but was missing.

"I don't know how to do that," Jerin insisted.

"You can try!" hissed Pol.

"I could kill you trying," said Jerin.  Pol's eyes went a bit wide when he heard that.

"What are you talking about?"

"Think about it. The wall in the training room. The roof in the Library. Pol, I caused explosions. Big as the Guards' sling bombs. You've seen what one of those does to a person, right?" The day had been a couple of years ago, but both Jerin and Pol remembered the Guard who had been rushed into the medic's hall after a training exercise had gone wrong. There had been a long trail of blood for the acolytes to mop up through the passageways and the sounds of the screaming had seemed to echo for days afterwards.  The sling bomb had torm the Guard up horribly, with one arm dangling and his torso a bleeding mess. The Guard had not survived.

Pol rubbed at his chest. "I've got a bomb strapped to me?"

"I don't know. But I don't think we should take that chance. Not when there are better options." Pol's eyes focused on Jerin again. He gave a nod, but his face was still a stony mask.

"So, you had this connection dangling out there for the Trinity to see. By the Trinity, Jer. You spent half that time whispering at me about how you could see the thread things that were holding Punisher and D-death together." He stuttered slightly at the name.

"Yeah, I know." Jerin felt his face flush all over again.

"And you're sure they saw you."

"They looked right at me, all of them."

"Then why aren't they here right now?" Pol also was looking around the room. The windows were high up on the walls. The only way in or out was the main doors. Both boys watched them worriedly.

"I don't know. Maybe they don't know who I am. Maybe they can't find this thread." He waved his hand.

"There aren't a lot of yellow-haired boys in the Temple. If they saw you, it wouldn't take a lot of investigating to figure out who you are," Pol said.

This time it was Jerin's turn to throw his hands up with exasperation and try to hold his voice down. "I don't know. Maybe they feel like they've got all the time in the world. We have to get out of here before time runs out."

Pol nodded. "I have a few things to take. Need to go to my family first."

Jerin shook his head. "We need to get Nessa first."

Pol flexed a fist and for a moment, Jerin though his friend was going to punch him.

"She's at the other end of this line, Pol. She's got this pointing straight at her. I don't know if it matters how far we go, she'll be a visible target for them."

"Fine, but you know that she's not going to believe any of this. Good luck getting her to do anything as stupid as leaving town with two runaway acolytes. You do remember the punishment for runaways, right?" Pol left that hanging.

"Yes, but I'd rather face that than angry gods, if that's what they are."

"Then if we're doing this, we're doing it right. No coming back." Pol stuck out his hand, and Jerin grasped it. They shook once.

"Nightfall," was what Jerin said.

Levifid was starting to get uncomfortable. He hadn't thought this through very well, and his biology was failing him. He needed to relieve himself, but he had no one to spell him off and watch Sicaria if he did so. A number of priests, acolytes and other servants of the Temple had come by while he had waited. They all reacted with surprise to find one of the all-powerful Trinity standing in the window alcove. None stopped to ask him why he was there. Levifid knew better than to ask any of them to help him. If Sicaria tried to leave when there was a priest watching, she would probably kill the priest and be gone. No one but a dominus could constrain another dominus.

He had expected Sicaria to have made a move before now. The sun was falling behind the western wall of the city. She had been in her apartments for the whole day, not even coming to the balcony to look outside. If she had made an attempt to leave, it would be different. She would know that he was waiting and watching.

Levifid admitted to himself that he could not keep this up forever. He needed to devise a way that he could monitor her until she lost interest, whenever that would be. As much as he did not want to, he would have to get closer to her. The only way to be assured of her location would be to be physically present. He couldn't tie a leash to her: she could undo anything he could do. It was risky. He considered just letting her do what she would with the boy and whoever he had attached himself to. But he couldn't. An age ago, Thera had awoken in him some of his genetically suppressed humanity. He couldn't do it.

Moving as quickly as he could, Levifid found the nearest lavatory and then proceeded to Sicaria's door. His stomach growled as he raised his hand to knock. He would need to find some food, too.

Levifid waited. There was no answer. He knocked again. Still, there was no answer.

After giving her several minutes to come to the door, Levifid was content that he had been polite enough. Carefully, he wove delicate probes of dark fiber. They penetrated the door and extended into the interior. As they touched objects and surfaces inside, he gained an appreciation of the layout of the apartments and what lay within. What he was looking for was Sicaria herself. He was not as skilled at this as Melior, and he could not do what Darla had been able to, back in the days of Settlement. She could practically see through walls, her senses were so acute.

It did not take long to cover the whole space. There was no sign of Sicaria.

The doors burst open with Levifid's impatience, the latch mechanism shattering. He strode in, looking about for the diminutive dicatrix.

The rooms looked barely lived in. The sheets on the soft bed were unrumpled. The fruits in the bowl on the table were untouched. Even the pitcher of wash water was full. It did not take more than a couple of seconds for Levifid to realize that Sicaria was not in here. When she had left and by what means, he did not know.

Fear tried to rise up from his limbic system, but the emotional dampers his makers had given him clamped down, allowing him to think clearly. His first concern was for the boys. He would consider the method of her evasion another time. He grabbed what appeared to be a variety of plum from the fruit bowl as he left Sicaria's rooms with all the haste he could muster.

He elected to use the dark fibers to speed his movement. Like invisible octopus' arms, he was flung down the hallways by their thrust. His feet did not touch the floor: to the human observer, he was flying. It was faster and more dignified than running. Melior might reprimand him if he was seen running. But flying like this, he was a dark blur sweeping past.

He reached the dormitory row and had to stop and ask for directions to the one he sought. As he expected, it was not difficult to find the blond boy's whereabouts. The child acolyte, probably less than ten years old, stared up at Levifid.

"There is an older acolyte, one with blond hair. Which dorm does he live in?"

"Jerin is in that one. Rank Twelve." The boy was more fascinated than frightened, Levifid thought. That was good, in his opinion.

"Thank you."

"He in trouble again?" asked the boy.

"No, why do you ask?" Levifid didn't have the time, but it would have been rude to ignore the question.

"Just the last time he blew a hole in the roof of the library. Maybe he did something like that again."

Levifid hadn't expected such an answer, and his mind reeled. This was more evidence that the blond boy—Jerin—was reaching out and touching dark fibers. It was easy to imagine an untrained and unguided youth causing damage to things and people.

"Nothing like that. Thank you."

The boy bowed deeply and formally and did not rise until Levifid was well down the corridor outside the dorm with "Rank 12" on the door.

There was no sign of any damage on the door itself, beyond the wear of long years of acolytes travelling through it. Inside, there were many acolytes, all of them shocked to see one of the Trinity enter their midst. Of Jerin and his friend, Pol, there was no sign. *No, Sicaria had not been there. No, they didn't know where Jerin and Pol were.*

It was getting dark outside. Levifid had lost Sicaria and the boys. Without searching the Temple from top to bottom, he was at a dead end.

"You're lucky my older brothers are bigger than I am," said Pol. Jerin was fidgeting with the belt on his pants. He had never worn any clothes other than the robes and fitness gi of an acolyte. Not that he could remember, anyways. To wear the clothes of a regular person who lived in Victoria was ironically the first time he'd ever been inconspicuous in his life, but at the same time he felt like his clothes were screaming 'look at me!'

They were in the alley, below the windows of Pol's family's home. The street level of this place was a cobbler's, and the [name] families had an apartment above it. Pol had led Jerin up a climb to get inside and then back down again. Jerin had two changes of clothes in his pack, courtesy of Pol's eldest brother's locker. Pol had been able to take clothes that were his own. He had some non-Order clothes for the few days per year that he spent with his family.

Pol looked up at the climb and shugged. "I remember that climb being harder," he said. "I guess I must have grown."

"You wouldn't know it to look at you," Jerin ribbed. Pol punched Jerin in his belly but it was a light blow and he grinned when he did it. They were now as ready as they were going to be. They had made it out of the Temple through the same chute that Nessa had used for years to get in. Luck had held and no one had stopped two acolytes out of the Temple and on the streets. Maybe with the events of the previous day, no one wanted to question anything that had to do with the Order.

Pol had wanted to see his parents one time before he left, but admitted that it would be better for them if they had no idea where he was or that he was gone. Still, Jerin had said nothing when Pol had stuffed a scrap of paper into his brother's now-emptier locker. 'I will be fine —P' was going to have to be good enough.

"We need to get to Nessa and out of the city," said Jerin, hitching at his pants again. It was the first time he'd worn them. It felt weird.

"We could just leave the city," suggested Pol.

"Pol, we can't." Jerin felt frustration. His friend was being irrational. "We leave, and the thread attached to Nessa is an arrow pointing to us, no matter where we go. We might as well leave directions where to find us."

"Yeah, I know," muttered Pol. "Let's get on with it then. Which way?"

Jerin pointed. It was towards the east. The Temple was just south of the center of Victoria. They had come into the northwest quadrant of the city in order to find Pol's family home. Now they needed to cross Victoria to find Nessa. It wasn't like they could lose her. Jerin could follow the thread right to her.

It was now well after sundown, and the streets of Victoria were dark. Some light spilled out from windows, but most were shuttered against the night. The intersections of the busiest roads had lamps illuminating them, but all that did was wreck their night vision as they plunged back into the black on the other side.

Some small open areas that had multiple buildings facing on them were small plazas and had tables and chairs of their own. These were evidently used as social meeting places, but tonight they were deserted. The arrival of the Trinity had not been shrugged off by the residents of the city.

Always, unerringly, the invisible cord connecting Nessa to Jerin led the way. There was no direct route, but with a guide like this it was not difficult to find a path. As they had to detour north or south, Jerin was getting a sense of how far away Nessa was. The triangulation effect was letting him know that they were getting closer all the time. Soon, they were close enough that Jerin could wave his left arm back and forth and it gave him a bead on the building she was in.

Jerin and Pol were in the shadows of a closed shopfront. The line was pointing to the third floor of the building on the other side and further down the street. They were stopped and looking, because there was a problem.

A shadowed figure was standing at the front of the building. Light from the windows above fell down on it, picking him out against the black of the night. The figure might have been overlooked, but Jerin could see more than the average person. That figure was tied up in a net of threads. Jerin recognized it: it was Death.

"We can't go around?" whispered Pol.

Jerin didn't answer. He was looking up at the lights of the third floor. Most of the shutters were closed, but light leaked from all of them. Someone was burning a lot of lamp oil in there. Nessa's line pointed directly into one of the rooms with the shutters closed.

"I think we're too late," said Jerin.

"Cut the line," whispered Pol.

"What? No, Pol." Jerin saw that Death was starting to move. He was leaving the position at the front of the building. He was moving down the street in their direction.

"Oh crap," muttered Jerin. "He's seen us."

"We're dead," said Pol. Jerin grabbed at Pol's arm, ready to start running with him, but Pol batted it away. "Why run? Why run, Jer? You said it yourself: they can find us wherever. If you aren't willing to try to cut the line, then you can never hide. And when they find you, they find me. Cut the line, damnit." Pol hissed the last.

"I can't do that!" Jerin was panicked. He could see Death coming towards them. He was only about thirty meters away now. Even without the line pointing to them, Jerin doubted that they would be able to run and hide at this point.

"Then cut me loose!" said Pol. "I've got nothing to lose." Jerin tore his eyes away from the approaching figure and looked at his friend.

"I don't know how, Pol!" Jerin felt powerless.

"Melior damn you, Jer! Try. Cut me lose. Then do her." Jerin could see Death stop. There was a scream from the apartment. It was a woman's scream. Jerin didn't know if it was Nessa or not.

Jerin was desperate. Another scream. followed the previous. He needed more time. He didn't know if it would help, but he grabbed Pol and started running in the opposite direction of Death and Nessa. Pol was a little slow to react, but soon they were running down the street in the darkness. The compact dirt of the street a was uneven underfoot, but they managed to keep their footing. Jerin darted into an alley. He didn't dare look back. If he was going to do this, he didn't think he could concentrate knowing that Death was still following them. He dodged several shadows, not knowing what they were in the blindness. He slid to a stop. Pol ran into the back of him, and they went down together. Desperately, they untangled themselves.

They were in a narrow alley, with two blind walls of buildings facing each other across a narrow strip of dirt. There was no sound of pursuit, but Jerin did not waste any time. "There. Put your back against that wall," he said, pushing Pol back.

"Why? What?" asked Pol, but he didn't resist. Jerin put his own back against the wall directly opposite his friend. He could barely make Pol out, his brown and grey clothing blending into the wall in the shadows. The single, small moon in the sky tonight was not casting any light down through the narrow gap to the sky. *Maybe if Death is coming, he'll not be able to see us and just float on by,* Jerin thought.

"I don't know if I can do this," he said. Pol did not reply. Jerin caught a suggestion of a nod in the dark, but it could have been his imagination. Ahead of him, clearer than anything else he could see, was the ghostly thread that ran from Jerin's chest to Pol's. Another of the larger, natural ropelike fibers was drifting through the alley as well, but Jerin ignored it. He had no idea how it was that he had created this thing. He only assumed that he had, but there was no other reasonable explanation. If this worked, then he would do the same for Nessa, if it wasn't already too late.

Jerin didn't know what he was doing. It didn't seem to matter if his eyes were open or closed, the thread was visible either way. He closed his eyes, and focused on the point where the thread was attached to himself. In the blackness, it was easier to do this, he noted. There were fewer distractions. A cat screeching startled him, making him lose his focus and looking around. There still was no evidence that Death was following them, but he needed to hurry up. The thread was impossibly thin, but at the same time, he could see it. It was almost a mirror-like effect around it, but that wasn't right. There was nothing to reflect. But it was the closest thing that he could imagine.

There was a point where the thread ended, right at his sternum. At that point, the line seemed to entangle with the bone. Jerin didn't.know how he knew that, but as he focused, it became clear to him that that was the case. The entanglements were finer than he could expect to be able to see, maybe finer than a hair, but he could make them out. *What to do?* he asked himself. When he interacted with the larger fibers, he had always used his hands, but there was no way that he could do anything manual to entanglements that were so fine. He focused on one tiny entanglement. It was like a shepherd's crook to his mind, a crook smaller than a mote of dust.

As he focused, he watched the hook shape straighten. There was a microscopic snap, like a tiny shock of static electricity. "It's working," Jerin whispered. "Brace yourself."

"For what?" Pol sounded frightened.

"I don't know. Maybe bite down on some thing, just in case." Jerin picked at the rest of the roots of the thread. One by one, they disengaged from his flesh. The feeling was odd. He remembered losing baby teeth. This was like that, except there was no empty socket left behind. As he worked, Jerin noticed that the thread had started to quiver. It was as though it was alive and anticipating being free. The last hook released.

Too late, Jerin opened his mouth to warn Pol. There was a snap. The thread dissipated, vanishing between one heartbeat and the next. The sound of a whip crack echoed in the alley. Pol gave a grunt and then fell to the ground. He was making gasping noises as though he was not able to breathe. Jerin had only felt the last little tingling snap as it had released. He crossed the two strides to his friend and crouched beside him.

"Pol! Pol! Are you okay?" Pol was writhing and making sucking noises. Jerin swore. *I've killed him. I killed him. I warned him.*

"Okay," Pol wheezed. "Wind. Knocked out." Pol continued to gasp for breath as Jerin hugged him, so relieved that he wasn't hurt badly. In a minute, Pol's breath came much more naturally and he was able to complain. "By the Words' dirtiest passage, Jerin. That bloody hurt." He was rubbing at the spot on his chest where the thread had been attached. Jerin stood up, a relieved laugh threatening to burst out. "It slammed me back. Like when Ayb would hit you with a kick in fighting class. I wasn't right against the wall. I might have been okay otherwise. Still would have hurt, though. " He paused. "You seem alright, though. What about you?"

"I was on the right end of it, I guess," Jerin said sheepishly.

"Bloody nasty thing to do to me," Pol grumbled.

"Hey, I told you I didn't know what I was doing, Stop whinging. You got your wish."

"Next time I wish for something, tell me to mind my own bloody business."

Jerin held out a hand and pulled Pol to his feet. There was a sound in the alley. Instantly, the two boys remembered where they were, and why. In a moment, they realized that it was an invisible rat, scratching at something in the dark.

"Would Death even make any footsteps?" muttered Jerin. Pol didn't say anything. "I am going to let Nessa go now," said Jerin.

"Wait! are you sure?" asked Pol, putting a hand on Jerin's shoulder.

"I think I have to," said Jerin. "It didn't hurt you as bad as I worried. I can do this."

"Wait, Jer. If she's not ready for it, it could kill her." Pol sounded genuinely concerned.

"I thought that was the point. You said it wan't that bad."

"I just told you it was like getting kicked by Ayb. What part of that sounds like a picnic to you?" said Pol. Jerin looked at the line running from his left hand, back in the direction of Nessa. He could break the line. It was not going to be nice for her, but she would be attached to him no longer. He flinched, remembering where it was attached. He opened his mouth to say he was going to do it, when the angle on the line changed. It was slow at first, but then it skewed radically. The line lifted upwards and towards the right, towards the south. He looked up, and started running. Pol gave a squawk and then Jerin heard him start to give chase. They scrambled to a stop where the alley ended at the street. Pol didn't know what Jerin was looking at, but Jerin looked up.

The line from his left hand shot straight up into the dark, starry sky at three black dots. The largest of the dots was connected to his hand, the other two moving close by. He could only see them as they moved in front of stars or the soft moonlight on the few clouds in the sky. His heart plummeted to his feet. They were taking her. But what drew Jerin's attention was the threads. His line reached out and touched the dark motes in the sky, but from each of the flyers, long lines reached out and touched the ground, the buildings and propelled them through the sky. He likened it to seeing long-legged insects, but that wasn't right. As the figures moved, the lines stretched and shrank, then dissipating as they fell too far behind, with new ones forming ahead. It was like what he had done with Pol, releasing the thread, but these were being done as he as was watching, an impossible feat of maneuvering.

"What? What are you looking at?" said Pol, breathing heavily. Jerin pointed, knowing that without the ability to see the threads in the night, there was no way that Pol would be able to see anything.

"They are taking her," he said. "You said they could fly..." his voice trailed off. Jerin had not seen what Pol had seen, the previous day when the Trinity had come down from the sky. Until now, Jerin hadn't really thought about what that had meant. Maybe he hadn't even believed his friend's story. But he believed it now. "They aren't flying, they're... crawling. Through the sky," he whispered.

"What? Where?" asked Pol. "Where are they going?" Jerin had no problem seeing where they were going. They were going back to the menacing, crouching shape of the Temple.

It only took the boys a minute to get back to where Nessa's family lived. Jerin raced up the stairs that ran up the outside of the building to the first landing and then the second. The door to the apartment was hanging off its hinges. There was lots of light inside, but there was also the flickering of a fire. One of the lamps had fallen over, and oil had splashed over the floor in once corner. Pol Immediately ran to the fire, grabbing a heavy blanket from the back of a chair and threw it over top, smothering the flames.

Jerin moved from room to room, and found Nessa's family, huddled together, cradling an unconscious figure. It was Nessa's father, Malth. Jerin recognized him from the day that he came to the Temple, asking for Nessa to be allowed access to the Library. He was bleeding from the scalp, and there seemed to be a problem with one of his legs: it was at an odd angle. A woman that Jerin presumed was Nessa's mother was applying pressure to the head wound. She was directing a young girl to get a bandage, but they were two young girls and neither of them would move.

"Merise, please," said Nessa's mother. Merise's eyes were staring in fear at Jerin. Nessa's mother jumped when she saw that they were not alone. At first she tensed, but then relaxed.

"We're here to help," said Jerin. "Are you okay?" The mother nodded.

"Need a bandage for this. Merise, for the love of Melior, move, girl!" Merise, who looked to be Nessa's next-youngest sister, finally moved, opening a cupboard and pulling out a long length of gauze.

Nessa had been working at the shop all day. Her sisters had come down to help from time to time, but there really had been no need. After the arrival of the Trinity the previous day, it seemed like everyone was staying off the streets and in their homes. With the exceptions of women fetching water from the wells, there was hardly anyone on t he streets at all. And that had meant that no one had come into the store. Her father had spent most of the day sitting on the chair just inside the door to the shop, staring uneasily out onto the barren street. Nessa had made herself as small as possible, not wanting to bother him. She had worked quietly, going through every shelf, dusting and organizing, sweeping and anything else that needed doing.

Her parents had been up most of the night arguing about the Trinity. In a home that was only four rooms, it was impossible to have a secret argument. At first, Nessa had been relieved that her father had been willing to let her slide by without explaining where she had been when the Trinity had arrived. But as the night had deepened, the weight of the fear in the home had begun to affect her and her sisters, too. Her mother still missed her brother, executed so many years ago by the Order. To her, the coming of the Trinity would make things worse. Whatever depredations the Order had committed, with the Trinity behind them, it would be worse. Her father did not argue that, but instead would point out that they had no choice but to remain. They could not walk away from the shop and leave Victoria. They would have nothing and nowhere to go. Staying had its risks, but leaving was certain homelessness and starvation.

That would start the argument cycle again, with Mother imagining what might happen to them and their daughters. Eventually, Merise and ??? left their own beds and climbed up into Nessa's, huddling with their big sister under the blankets.

"It will be okay," Nessa whispered to them. She stroked their hair, and while the littlest one dozed off, she and Merise did not get much sleep at all. After spending the day watching the road, her father finally got up and put the closed sign in the door and lowered the shutters, there being no reason to remain open. Just as he did so, there was a knock at the door. Nessa watched her father crack open the shutter enough to see out. Then he visibly relaxed and unlocked the door and let Frank in. Frank was the goldsmith in town, and his shop was only one block over.

Dusk was already settling outside, and Frank blinked in the lights of the shop. He was a thin man with a receding hairline and large eyebrows, who always stood with a pronounced stoop. He spent so many long hours working on fine jewelery or other decorative pieces that the position was permanent now. Frank F'marin was a successful man, and had eight children with his wife Marianne. Nessa knew them well. She thought that her father fancied Frank's eldest, Imad, as a potential match for her. The thought made her hitch at her dress, adjusting the fabric on the scars on her back.

"Malth, Malth," he said as a simple greeting. He peered around the store, and jerked slightly when he saw Nessa there. He gave a polite nod to her, but didn't pay her any particular mind. Nessa was entering the figures into the shop ledger. There weren't that many sales to tally. It would not take long.

"Frank," was her father's reply. "Can I offer you anything? *Cupam*?" He walked over to the cabinet behind the counter, and pulled up the small decanter and two thimble-sized glasses.

"Don't mind at all," said Frank. "Could use a drink. This Trinity thing has got the whole town screwed up so tight a pin dropping could cause a riot." Malth put one of the glasses down in front of his guest. Frank picked it up between thumb and forefinger, saluted her father, and they both drank the small amount of brown alcohol together. Nessa gave a slight shudder. One time she had snuck behind the counter and tried a sip of the *cupam*. It was not an experience that she wanted to relive. It had burned.

Frank twirled the glass between his fingers, looking at the glass in the lamplight. "You ought to get a finer set of these, you know," said Frank. "I've got this set chased in silver in my shop..."

"You know that I only ever have the stuff with you," said her father with mock seriousness. "If you want to drink out of better cups, why don't you bring one with you?"

"Just seems a shame to have such fine drinks out of... well, never mind that." He put the glass down. Malth picked up the decanter and poured another tiny amount into it and another for himself. After that, he put the decanter back into the cabinet. Both glasses remained untouched, though. "This Trinity business. It's a bad thing," Frank said. "Saw them come down. was visiting Shyman, in his shop just off the Square."  Malth nodded. "Saw what they did to the Highest, and the others, too." He made the sign of the Bowl and Sphere, and Malth did the same. "I know you don't have truck with the Order. Not since... well, I can't blame you, but you gotta keep your head down, as they say."

"It's Mari who has the history," said her father. "I can't say's what happened to her brother was wrong. I only know what I heard." Nessa was upset by what her father was saying. He knew that what had happened to Uncle XXX had been wrong. But she understood that he needed to not offend or let the wrong word slip where the wrong ear might hear.

"There were some good men who died yeserday. It was only two weeks ago that I was at Moed F'horus' shop, getting a new pair of shoes made. Was his brother in that bunch."

"Moed? I didn't know his brother was a priest." said Malth.

"Sure was," said Frank. He sucked at his teeth. "Probably was over fifty now. He was the second-oldest son of Horus'. Remember him when I was only this high." Frank held his hand out at about waist level.

"Moed's good people, how's he holding up?" asked Malth.

"Don't know, but I'll stop by there to pay my respects. Tulan was the brother's name. Just remembered it now."

Malth picked up his tiny glass. Frank did the same. "To Tulan," he said solemnly. Frank nodded, and they both crank their *cupam*, although slower this time.

"I wanted to discuss something with you, Malth," said Frank, putting his glass down, but then pushing it around the countertop with a finger.

"I thought as much, Frank. What is it?"

"Just with the Trinity. Second coming and all that." There was a pause. Frank looked a little uncomfortable. Nessa saw her father shoot her a look, like he was going to ask her to leave, but then Frank started speaking again. "I've got a bit put aside. So have a few other of the fellows. I don't know if you do or not, but... there's no harm in being prepared."

"Prepared for what?" asked Math.

"Don't know," said Frank. "but then until the chopping block came out, I daresay none of those priests knew either, if you catch my meaning."

"You thinking of leaving?" her father asked carefully.

"Not as such. Not much call for a man of my talents in the mining camps or the farm villages. But... I can't say that I won't be ready to run if things go bad." Nessa agreed silently. There was no other city the size of Victoria in Arnath. If you left Victoria, you were heading to a forthouse at best, and those were mostly in the Eastern Marches, or up against the Barrier Range. Not an easy life.

As she was thinking that, she caught a sense of motion out of the corner of her eye. It was there, and then it was gone. She looked down at the ledger, but there was nothing there.

"I will always put my family first," her father said slowly. "Mari and I had a talk last night." Nessa almost choked at the way her father said that with a straight face. "Not easy to contemplate leaving everything behind."

"Not saying I'm going to. I'm just... putting out the word. There's a group who are going to all be watching and listening. Can I put you on the list?"

"You can. Don't know what I'm listening for, though."

"I don't either," said Frank, "but I'll know it when it happens. and then you'll be the next to know. Deal?" He stuck out his hand. Malth took it, and they shook once. "Thanks for the drink," said Frank. He adjusted his coat, and her father walked his guest to the door. He unlocked the door and held it open for Frank to leave.

"Keep thinking I'll see that Shade," Frank said with a grin, looking out into the darkening light outside.

"I dunno, I think the Serpent is the one that makes my skin crawl," said her father. "Stuff of nightmares."

"They're all disturbing," said Frank. "Nothing like them in the Words, that is for certain. Anyways. Good evening." He slid through the doorway and was gone. Malth pushed the door shut and locked it again. He saw Nessa watching him.

"He's a good man. Just weighing his options. Like any man should."

"Sounds like he agreed with Mother," said Nessa.

"You heard that, last night." Nessa just gave him a look.

"Well, your mother feels pretty strongly about things. Give her life to protect you three. She'd rather see us alive and poor than the alternative. Frank's got a point, but I don't think it's time to panic. It's not like the Trinity's at our door."

There was a knock at the door. This time, her father jumped at the sound, then grinned sheepishly at his daughter. "Just Frank back." He unlocked the door, and it was not Frank that was standing there. The person who stood there, illuminated from the light spilling out, was a woman, robed in black. She was shorter than Malth, but there was something that radiated malice from her. A black aura flowed into the room as soon as the door opened. Such was the effect that Nessa did not event notice Death standing behind her, skeletal face gleaming bone-white in the lamplight. Her father fell to his knees.

Sicaria did not seem to notice. She directed her eyes—the irises were red, Nessa noticed—around the confines of the shop, coming to stop on Nessa. She felt frozen. She was unable to move.

"Nessa!" he father hissed. He was looking at her from where he was kneeling. His hand made a motion to urge her to kneel as well. She wanted to comply, but felt riveted by Sicaria's stare. Of their own volition, Nessa's feet turned her away from the door and the visitors to the shop. She moved very slowly, almost like in a dream. At the back of the shop was the inside stair that led up to the F'nam family's home on the second floor and her own on the third. She expected to be stopped. She expected a command to stop at the very least, but nothing came as she walked through the doorway and to the bottom of the steps. Her knees almost gave way at the first stair, but she stayed upright.

"Lady Sicaria, welcome to our—" her's father's words were cut off by a impact and a loss of breath. There were now other footsteps behind her, treading across of the shop floor. Nessa climbed the stairs at a deliberate pace. She was not trying to run away, as such. Her brain was screaming at her to get away from the woman but at the same time she realized that there was no escape. To run would be to start a chase that she would not win. This was only putting space between herself and the threat.

When she was only a few steps from her door, she was startled by a yell from below. It was her father. "Mari! Take the kids and run!" he bellowed. The only effect that the tell had was to bring her mother to the door, opening it and looking out with confusion on her face as she saw her eldest daughter sleepwalking toward her. She stepped aside for Nessa, but then caught her breath, putting a hand to her mouth as she saw who was following her up the stairs at the same pace.

"Don't!" Nessa said as her mother slammed the door in Sicaria's face. What good would a few planks of wood do against one of the Trinity? She watched, and in a second the door was wrenched off of its hinges, the latch shattering.

Nessa heard her sisters start to scream.

Levifid was worried. He had spoken to a number of acolytes and to the boy Jerin's teaching priest. He had taken all of their suggestions as to Jerin's favorite places in the Temple, or most likely places that he might be found. He had been to all of them. The Library he had wanted to stay and explore, but once it was clear that the boy was not there, he continued his search. What made it strange was that Levifid knew that Jerin had two fibers attached to him. It should have made it trivially easy to find him when there were arrows pointing him out. But there was no trace of the blond acolyte. It was near full dark outside. Given that he had not found a trace of Jerin or Sicaria, he feared the worst.

He strode along a passage on the upper level of the Temple. To his left were a series of arched windows. They looked down onto the courtyard at the front of the Temple. Levifid had ended up here, trying to sweep for the fiber that he had seen connecting Jerin to something or someone out in the City. It was a faint hope at this point, but he did not want to retreat to his quarters. There he would only have his own thoughts to accompany him. Here, at least he could appreciate the place the humans had built over many centuries. There were echoes of Roman and Gothic in the architecture, sometimes aiming for beauty, and others just for functionality. Given what he knew of the history in the Green Zone, Levifid assumed that the people who had built this place might have re-invented a lot of the architectural prinicples that he was seeing.

The gilt work on the lamps that were lighting the halls added a sparkle to what was predominantly grey stone, and rugs and wall hangings added color and some needed softness. There were some areas, like the corridor outside the main Hall and the Hall itself, as well as some f of the teaching halls that had timber panelling. That added a sense of life and warmth to what was primarily a very cold and echoing building.

Levifid was almost at the end of the corridor when he spotted movement outside. It was not a thing of vision, but the sense of the dark fibers that signalled him. There were multiple people alighting in the courtyard, from being suspended on strands of fiber through the air. Levifid went to the window and looked down. In the dim lights shining out there, he could only make out shapes. But it did not take Levifid long to deduce what was happening. There were only four others besides himself on Tero who could travel this way, and three of them were now in the courtyard.

Shade, barely registering visually, jumped out at Levifid's senses of dark fibers. The strands that made her look the way she did were unmistakeable. The same could be said for Death, who was also there. The last two figures were too small to be Melior. That made one of them Sicaria, in her dark robes almost invisible in the night like Shade. That left one unknown.

At first, Levifid assumed it to be Jerin, being brought back to the Temple from some other place, That was backed up by the faint thread that he could see, extending off in the direction they had just arrived from. But it was clear that this figure was not wearing acolyte white. And there was only one connection that Levifid could see. Jerin had had two. Hurrying, Levifid tried to navigate his way from where he was down to the Entrance Hall. It was not easy with the haphazard layout of the Temple. By the time he reached it, the Hall was empty. But the fiber tagging the unknown person gave him all the help he needed to follow quickly.

Levifid caught up with Sicaria just outside her quarters. "Sicaria, stop." He tried to put some authority into his voice, but it had no real effeat. Sicaria continued to drag the prisoner along with her. Levifid could see that this person had dark hair, so it definity was not Jerin. Then he perceived that it was a female, from the clothing and the higher pitch to her voice as she struggled against Sicaria.

"Thera, stop," he said. This did not need any volume or authority. It brought Sicaria to an immediate halt. She whirled to face him, her red eyes wide and filled with anger. The young woman was sobbing softly, and fell to her knees, her arms still in Sicaria's grip. "I cannot allow you to take her," said Levifid. Sicaria's mouth twisted into a sneer. She turned and resumed dragging the young woman. The woman awkwardly stumbled back to her feet from her knees. Levifid could see that Sicaria was enhancing her own strength by means of the same sort of technique that she had used on Punisher. Levifid made a note of it. he would have to remember that she would automatically be stronger than he was. It was not as extreme as Punisher.

Levifid reached out with dark fibers. This was not difficult to do. While Sicaria was very adept, she was not strong in her use of the dark fibers. Levifid blocked her way, bringing Sicaria to a stop. She turned to face him again, anger etched on her face. As delicately as he could, Levifid used dark fibers to lever Sicaria's hand open. The young woman fell to the floor, but Levifid cushioned the fall and then lifted her up and away from Sicaria. Sicaria's eyes fixated on the young woman, watching her being taken away.

Sicaria gave a scream, and then turned away. Levifid let her go. He watched her dark, robed figure rush down the hall and into her quarters. The doors closed with a crash. Several more crashes were audible from inside the rooms. Levifid winced at the damage that the angry dictatrix was doing. He placed the young woman down gently, still supporting her. She was swaying on her feet, her eyes not really focusing on what was around her. Several contusions were visible on her face. Her lower lip was split and bleeding, but her limbs all appeared to be whole.

A full medical examination would have to wait for now. He was surprised at how young his this woman was. She was probably less than eighteen, if he was any judge of such things. She was dressed much as Levifid had seen the women of the City dressed: a modest dress of dark brown wool, with a linen blouse underneath, and long sleeves. The dress stopped just short of sweeping the floor. Sturdy leather shoes peeked out from below. Her face was oval and framed by dark hair that was gathered back into a queue, although much of it had escaped, either due to her rough treatment or the flight through the night.

"Come, let me get you looked at," he said. She reacted, with her eyes focusing on him, but nothing else. Levifid noticed that the thin fiber that was attached to her, was in a very delicate place. *Why on earth...* he began, until his mind caught up. The strand that had been attqched to the boy in the Hall when he had seen him had been attached to his hand... If he had been capable, Levifid might have blushed. As it was a small smile quirked his lips.

## Realization

Nessa was in a walking dreamlike state. Visions of her home being invaded mixed with the sensations of being led down a hall of the Temple by a very tall man in a dark robe. The robe made her want to shy away. It was like the one that Sicaria had worn. She could still see Sicaria's cruel face and her father falling.

She didn't know if he was alright.

There was the sensation of dakrness and cold wind blowing past her as she was flung through the night sky.

Nessa didn't know where this tall man had come from, but following him had to be better than being dragged by Sicaria. Almost without transition, she found herself lying down, with a priest looking down on her with concern on his face.

*A priest? Am I dying?* She felt strong hands on her, pressing, flexing her limbs. There were bruises in places and they caused her to cry out. Then she was raised to a sitting position, and a warm drink was raised to her lips. She drank, and immediately a warm sensation entered her belly. It roused her and the memories faded and she was more aware of the here and now. It took her a moment.

"You are in the Temple," said a strange voice.

"The Medic Hall?" she asked. Her lip was fat, and the words were painful to say.

"No, not the Medic Hall, but in the Temple." It was a deep, gentle voice. Nessa's eyes followed it to its source, a long, pale face with blue eyes and short dark hair. Nessa felt panic and immediately tried to get up and flee. She did not manage to move more than a few cents when gentle, strong hands that she could not see restrained her. She strugged for a moment longer. "Do not fear, girl. I am not here to harm you." Nessa gave up, falling back against the pillows that were propping her up. The face was attached to a long body in a dark robe. He was looking at her without emotion on his face.

"You are—are Levifid," she said. A slight smile touched his lips.

"I am, my dear. Perhaps you would do me the honor of telling me your name."

For a moment, Nessa considered lying. She did not want to be known to the Trinity. If she was never known by a single one of them, that would suit her just fine. But she remembered her home and her family, already victimized by Sicaria. She was already known. And this one seemed to want to help her. "Nessa. Nessa F'malth," she said.

"I am pleased to meet you, Nessa," said Levifid. "Are you feeling well enough to move? I would like to wait for Jerin to join us in a place that is more comfortable and less public."

"You know Jerin?" Nessa asked, but then bit her tongue. It was one thing to give her own name, and quite another to mix Jerin up in this.

"Perhaps not as well as you do," Levifid said with another slight smile. "I an very impatient to speak to him. I suspect that he is a very interesting person. Perhaps unique on the planet."

"Did you call for him?" asked Nessa, looking around. The rooms they were in were very comfortable. Everything she looked at was more finely appointed than any place she had ever seen. Each piece of furniture was a uniform deep dark wood, with curves and ornate scrollwork that spoke of master craftsmen and long hours in the making. The seat cushions were a rich, deep purple velvet. Hangings on the walls showed a mix of intricately embroidered patterns but also scenes that were sewn in. Again, masters' work. The furniture did not fit the man who was there with her, though. Through the open doorway into the bedchamber, Nessa could see that two beds had been pushed together to fit this man.

"No. I have in fact been searching for him all afternoon. As it turns out, he did the one thing that I didn't think an acolyte was allowed to. He left the Temple. He is returning, now."

"How do you know that?" asked Nessa. If Jerin was out of the Temple, she didn't want him coming back. Not when the Trinity was looking for him.

"Are you aware that you have a physical attachment to him?" said Levifid. Nessa blushed.

"Well, I think he's cute, and I like him a lot," she said. Levifid cleared his throat.

"That is not what I meant. I mean that there is a bond that is connecting the two of you. You might not be aware of it, as it is not visible to the human eye." Unbidden, she glanced down at her chest. When she looked, there was nothing, but she could have sworn there was something there out of the corner of her eye.

"I see you are aware. That is an interesting thing to know. I would have put a wager on the neither of you knowing about it. That changes a lot. I know that Jerin is returning, because I can see the angle on your link changing. It indicates that the anchor at the other end is approaching the Temple right now. It was this link that I thought would lead me to him this afternoon, but it led me to you first."

"What do you want from me?" asked Nessa. "My family, they... she hurt them. I need to go." Levifid blinked.

"I hadn't considered that." Outside the room, Nessa heard a bell ring. A few seconds later, there was a discreet knock at the door.

"Enter," Levifid said. When the face and shoulders of a servant came through the door, looking in every direction and then fixating on Levifid, he spoke to the man. "Please send medical help to..." he indicated that Nessa should speak.

"Number 6, Greenfield Lane. Third floor." She flinched when giving her address, but they already knew her name. She would hide nothing from them that they couldn't figure out for themselves, and time was precious.

"Bring back anyone who needs medical attention," instructed Levifid, "and anyone else who wishes to come. Let me know when they are here and seen to." The servant bowed his way back out of the doors and they closed silently. "I am sorry, I should have been thinking more clearly. Wherever Sicaria goes unattended, pain and suffering follow." Silence took the room. Nessa watched Levifid, but did not want to speak. She still felt disoriented and didn't trust herself. Jerin was coming. Her family would be brought to the Temple, too. There wasn't anything that she could do. Something clicked into place.

"She could sense the connection," she said. It wasn't a question. But the answer to the question that had been screaming inside her mind since Sicaria had appeared at her father's door. *Why had she come? What did she want from me?*

"Yes. She could sense it the same as I can. In fact, we both noted it earlier today when we saw young Jerin. It was impossible to miss. At that time, neither of us knew who or what was at the other end, but it was something that neither of us would be content with until we dicsovered what was behind it. It turned out it was you."

"Look Jerin," said Pol. "I don't want to do this. You said that once we left, we were gone for good. No looking back. It's only a couple of hours later, you realize that, don't you?" They were hiding in the shadows of a closed shop front, the last one before the street they were on opened into the square in front of the Temple. The Temple was well-lit compared to every other building in the City, with lamps shining from windows and even playing on the massive walls and the hanging gardens that decorated them. The lights reached out but failed to touch them, leaving the boys in darkness.

"Nessa's in there, Pol."

"And what difference does that make? You said we weren't coming back for any reason. Tell me you don't remember saying that."

"I said it. I meant it. But I saw Nessa being... flown here by Sicaria. You saw her, you know what sort of person Sicaria is. I can't leave Nessa with her. I can't." It was the same argument they had had when they had left Nessa's home. Her father, Malth, had been unconscious. The middle daughter had been cradling an arm that didn't want to move right, and her mother had one eye that was swollen shut. They boys had done as Mrs F'craven had asked, and run to fetch the local healer. After that, they hadn't gone back. There was nothing else they could do there. Maybe the less they remembered of the two boys, the better.

Jerin had been determined to follow the thread back and find Nessa. It was only when it was clear that it was leading back to the Temple that Pol had objected, more forcefully with each passing house and building. "We're going to have enough trouble getting through the gates as is," he had said. "If they raise the alarm, we won't stand a chance. You realize that we are inside a walled city with no way out except the gates, right?" But Jerin wouldn't stop, and now he was preparing to re-enter the Temple.

"What are we supposed to do?" asked Pol. "We are talking about gods who can fly and rip doors off hinges. Who knows what else? If half the stories are right, they can move worlds, bring fire down from the sun. Who are we to try to interfere?"

That did make Jerin stop. He hadn't really thought about what he could do. Trust Pol, the master debater and silver-tongued acolyte to hit on something as important as that. For a moment, Jerin's resolve wavered. Then he took a breath and straightened.

"We haven't done anything wrong... as long as they don't know that we left the Temple yet," he said. The last was a bit sheepish. "Even if there's nothing that we can do right away, I guarantee there's nothing will be able to do if we run. And I couldn't live with that." He shifted his pack. They had left their acolyte robes at Pol's place. They would have to figure out how to sneak some more before Q'docet saw them out of uniform. If he found them dressed like this, there would be no way to explain it. "Besides, you're free now. You shouldn't be of any interest to the Trinity any more."

Pol rubbed at his chest. "Yeah, don't remind me." He sighed. "I'll do this. But I'm doing it for you, not for the girl. You are going to need help to stay out of the cells. I'm sure of that."

"You do it for whatever reasons seem right to you," said Jerin, and he slipped through the shadows, heading for the way in.

Levifid watched the girl, Nessa. He didn't know what he was looking at, but there was something odd about her. It wasn't her injuries. It was like there was a... spark inside her. Something odd. He puzzled about it for a while before speaking again. "Do your injuries hurt you, child? I can ask for the medic to provide one of the painkillers, if they have such a thing."

"What's a painkiller?" Nessa flinched away, eyes wide.

"A drug or concoction that takes away pain. It dulls the pain receptors."

"Oh," she said. "I thought... pain... killer..." It took Levifid a second to realize what Nessa was getting at.

When he realized how the word could easily be misinterpreted, he gave a low chuckle. "I'm sure they must have some medifations to dull pain," he said. He got up and poured Nessa a glass of water from the pitcher. He returned and handed it to her. She took it and drank it in gulps.

"Your hand, how did that happen?" he asked. When Nessa had reached for the glass, she had first done it with her dominant right hand, but then changed her mind and taken it with her left, protecting the right. There was a bandage on the hand that didn't look like one that the medic had done in the Temple. It looked older and needed to be changed. It was a rag with dry blood soaking through it.

"Nothing, I just cut it," she said. Levifid did not consider himself an expert in understanding human communication, but he sensed that this was not the truth. Something about the nature of the cut reminded him of things that had happened thousands of years ago, but only a short time ago in his experience. He remembered visiting two other young women in prison cells. Two women who each had had cuts on their right palms. Those women had been bled into Sicaria's artifact, changing them forever. He already suspected that somehow Jerin had been exposed to the Bowl and Sphere. *Could this girl have as well?* The synapses in Levifia's dominus brain were firing rapidly.

Instantly, his imagination unraveled the possibilities that this might have. The most important thing was knowing that the Trinity might not be the only fiber wielders on the planet. One of the things that had shocked Melior upon meeting the first priest of the Order in the first village they had come to after leaving the Dead Zone was that the priest had had no idea what dark fibers were. Extended questioning had revealed that all priests had gone through a ceremony with the Artifact when they were raised. Sicaria's eyes had brightened and a maniacal glee had taken over her face. It was clear from the priest's story that the Artifact had survived the chaos that had followed the crash of the Compass Rose. It could be nothing else from the description. And yet, here the priest was with no tranformation. No description of the effect that the bowl and sphere had on those who gave their DNA to activate it. The priests that they had met in subsequent villages had told the same story when properly motivated. None said any more than they had bled into the bowl and then been raised to the Order. Certainly none of them had tried to defend themselves as a dominus might when being beaten by the raw energy of dark fibers. Not even in the last defense of their lives.

Melior had surmised that perhaps the Artifact had been damaged in some way. Neither he nor Levifid knew how it worked. There was no denying that it was a complex machine, and it was easy to imagine a small shock or misalignment rendering it inoperative. Sicaria had neither agreed nor disagreed when asked. She was agitated and wanted to get her hands on it. When she and Melior had found it in the cavern below this Temple, she had immediately claimed that it was fully operational.

"User error," Levifid had said when he had heard the news. Melior had scoffed that such a thing was impossible.

"Bleed into the bowl, put hand under the sphere. How could anyone get that wrong? Are these all idiots?"

He had been none too pleased to find out that this was the truth. The senior Keeper of the Records had been one of those executed in the square, but when Levifid had finally found the the junior Keeper, he made him find the oldest written words on the use of the Artifact. There, Levifid had read the words: "Blood from the acolyte, added to the universe to make it strong. A symbol of the pain and sacrifice that the world much must make to become pure. Change is the door to walk through to become one with Melior."

"Very few can read the oldest scripts any more, my Lord," the record keeper had said. He had listened as Levifid had translated the words to him. To Levifid, it was in plain English, but the modern peoples of Tero had only the loosest grasp of the language. To Levifid, only a few months had passed. But millenia of cultural change and language drift had rendered English unrecognizable to these priests. "That is one possible translation," said the Keeper, nodding. "There is some considerable debate on the matter. The word: door, it might mean a portal, or perhaps as Cle F'sant theorizes, it might be a reference to some sort of animal. Livestock, maybe." Levifid had looked at the man with an disbelieving stare, but did not see the point of correcting the man.

Levifid would have liked to have the priests demonstrate the raising ceremony for him, but the Artifact was now nowhere to be found. Sicaria had taken it away and neither he nor Melior knew where. It must have been somewhere in the City, since to their knowledge, Sicaria had not left it. But it was not in evidence in her rooms, and it was no longer in the chamber that had housed it for centuries. Melior had not seemed troubled by it.

"The priests are fine as they are. I don't want to bother transforming them. Would just be a complication that I don't need. I don't need to have people to fight domini any more. There are only the three of us. The Five will be enough of a help." So Melior had intended that there be no more people transformed by the bowl and sphere. None of the priests of the Order were transformed. And that ment that... he was looking at perhaps one of only two humans on Tero who had operated the Artifact correctly.

All of this had raced through Levifid's mind in less than a second from first recognizing the wound on Nessa's right palm, and putting that together with the strange effect that he could see inside her when he focused intently. She was freshly exposed to the Artifact. He couldn't help himself. Levifid rose and approached her. Without touching her, he reached her with the dark fibers, forcing her right hand outward, with the palm up. The bandage fell away, revealing a fresh wound. It was partly healed, but the depth of the cut and the lack of sutures meant that it would be some time before it healed properly. The edges were pink and swollen. If she was not careful, it could become infected.

"I will send for an antiseptic," he said, releasing her. Immediately, Nessa snatched her hand back, holding it protectively against her body.

It wouldn't do for this girl to be damaged. She and Jerin might be the most valuable people on the entire planet.

"Aren't you going to cut the connection?" asked Pol. He pulled a robe over his head. They had found a stack of clean white acolyte robes in the laundry where they re-entered the Temple. So far, they had not been detected, but they needed to be careful. Having a white robe on would only pass a cursory inspection. They were still wearing city clothes underneath. An encounter with a curious priest would raise questions that had no good answers.

"How would I know where she is if I did?" answered Jerin.

"Bloody fool. How would you know? How would they know if you did. They are probably watching you right now. You know she's here. That's enough. Cut her loose. It only hurts a bit." Jerin gave Pol a look at the white lie. He still didn't want to cut Nessa free without her preparing herself. Pol might assume that he was connected to Nessa in the same way that they had been, but Jerin thought that Nessa's attachment might be a lot more sensitive. He didn't want to injure any part of her. Her soft parts less than most.

"I'm going to go and find out where she is exactly," said Jerin, finishing tightening the belt on the robe.

"You're crazy. You don't want to do that. Go back to the dorm. It's way past curfew, but slip in, get into bed, and then play dumb if anyone asks where you were. Easy peasy. They you can do stupid things tomorrow." Pol's fists were on his hips.

"Right, and try to get some sleep? After what's happened tonight? Knowing that Sicaria is probably going to come down to the dorm and be standing at the foot of my bed when I open my eyes? No thanks, Pol." Jerin took the first coutle of paces towards the exit of the laundry when Pol grabbed his arm. Jerin stopped, and looked at Pol before jerking his sleeve free. "I'm doing this. I'm going to be the hunter, not the hunted." He left the room, looking both ways in the hall outside, watching and listening for anyone coming. It was late in the night now, and it was probable that the coming of the Trinity had had a dampening effect on the Order the same way it had made the streets of the City deserted. Regardless, it was Jerin's plan to s stick to the secret ways of the Temple. He figured there was less chance of meeting anyone there, including any of the Trinity.

Jerin wasn't expecting it, but soon he heard the sound of soft shoes on the hard floors behind him. He looked back, and spotted Pol following. His friend didn't look happy, but he was hurrying to try to catch up. He closed the gap just as Jerin was climbing up into the alcove behind the stature of Levifid. He didn't say anything. He didn't think Pol would appreciate any thanks.

"Statue doesn't look anything like him," Pol grumbled. "Too short by half a meter, too."

"I'd considered that," was all that Jerin said as he started down the narrow dark passageway that the statue silently guarded.

As the blackness closed in on them, Jerin's imagination started to run away on him. Each step, he expected to come face to face with a Trinity member, lying in wait in the dark. He knew this passage, and all of the others, as well as any of the main halls of the Temple, but for the first time since he was a little boy, they seemed like places of fear.

"I'm glad you're here, Pol," he said softly, not wanting his voice to carry.

"Yeah, that makes one of us," mutted Pol.

Nessa hissed when the clear liquid touched her cut palm. It looked like water, but it bubbled when it touched her skin and it hurt like fire. She didn't want to appear weak in front of this... dominus, he had called himself. Nessa had no idea what that meant, but she practiced the word in her mind as a way to take her attention away from the pain.

"Don't," he had said when she had thanked him. He had already given her a small cup of something bitter. She had grimaced at the taste, but immediately the pain in her head had lessened, and the aches and bruises from Sicaria's treatment were now strting to fade.

"I do not wish for the title of Lord, and I am not a god." Nessa had started to stutter an apology, but Levifid had continued. "Please don't tell Melior that I said that. He would not be pleased. I don't like the subterfuge, though." Nessa didn't know what a subterfuge was, but it sounded bad.

"It should heal better now," said Levifid, handing her a small pot of a salve that that the medic had delivered along with the painkiller and the disinfectant. Nessa was amused now by the word. Such a violent word for such a kindness. He shifted his focus, seemingly onto nothing, but Nessa saw his gaze take in her chest and the space that led from it. She was self-conscious of this—dominus—staring at her there, but he did not seem to be lecherous at all.

"I will leave you for a moment. I need to go and get Jerin. Otherwise, he might be found by others. Time is precious." In a graceful sweep of dark fabric, Levifid left her side and was out the doors. They had opened for him automatically, with no mechanism that Nessa could see. Nessa had no explanation for it, other than the obvious one: the Trinity were gods. And yet this one, Levifid, claimed otherwise. It was so confusing.

Alone in the room, Nessa considered running. There was no one here to stop her, and Levifid might not come back for a few minutes. Maybe it would be enough time to get into one of the back passages of the Temple. She could move quicker than someone who was not yet familiar with the routes through the maze that was the Temple.

Two things stopped her. The first was the evidence that the Trinity could track her. It was a reasonable conclusion, given the events of the night and what Jerin had told her about her connection, confirmed tonight by Levifid. It would be impossible for her to hide without being physically next to Jerin. Otherwise, the Trinity would stumble on the link and follow it to her. The second reason was the way that Levifid was treating her. Compared to the horror or dealing with Sicaria this evening, he was a model of good behavior and the polite host. He might have his own motivations, but at the moment, with all of the cards stacked against her, she was willing to give him a chance.

There was an odd feeling. Since Jerin had informed her of the fact that their connection was attached to the sensitive area around her left nipple, she had imagined that she could feel it. Sometimes she could, but it required a large motion by Jerin to be felt. But this was not that. It was almost like she could point in a direction and know that Jerin was there. She could not see or hear any evidence of if, but she was certain that the connection was pointing in the direction of the hall outside the room, where Levifid had gone. It was changing direction quickly.

Nessa jumped. The doors to the apartment opened, and Levifid stepped through followed by Jerin, and to her surprise, Pol. Jerin's face brightened when he saw her, but from the way that he spotted her immediately without having to scan the room, she knew that he had known she was here all along. She gave him a smile but immediately regretted it. Her lip split again and she could taste fresh blood. Pol stepped inside and then stood sullenly near the doors as they closed again. He ran his gaze over the whole room, finally landing on Nessa and then jerking away when he saw her looking in his direction.

"Nessa, you're alright?" asked Jerin. He sounded worried, but came close and did not touch her. He held back, in that endearing way he had. Always so physically reserved. She doubted anyone had so much as hugged him since he was taken from his family as a toddler. He ran his eyes over her, assessing any damage. "Le—Levifid said you were okay." He stumbled over the name of the god he had grown up worshipping. "Your family thought you might be dead."

Nessa went wide-eyed at that and looked to Levifid. He raised a hand in caution. "I sent word. Your family should know you are alive by now, and will be cared for," he said.

"You're okay?" Jerin repeated.

"Yes, except for some bruises. I was more worried about my father than me." She tried to sound brave when she said it, but her, voice betrayed her by quavering a little. She flinched as she remembered the terror as Sicaria had trapped her with invisible bonds, and swatted away her father's attempts to stop her. The woman had been singularly focused on Nessa, but her family had tried their best to stop whatever Sicaria had been doing. That's when they had... She stopped thinking about it.

"Yes, I am afraid that Sicaria can be... harsh," said Levifid. There was a tinge of sadness in the way he said it, but no emotion touched his face. "She has exhibited that behavior ever since... well, long before your great-ancestors were born. It does not matter right now." Nessa was sure that there was sadness in that. Levifid turned to Pol, still by the door. Pol was hugging himself, and refusing to look at Levifid. "And who might you be, young man?" Levifid asked. Pol glared at Levifid then looked away, saying nothing. "A man of caution, I see. I can't blame you, but realistically if I want to find out who the young acolyte is who is friends with Jerin N'patri, how difficult do you think that would be?" Levifid asked.

"Go ahead," said Pol.

"Pol, just..." began Jerin, and Pol's eyes went wide and he stared at his friend.

"Jerin! By the Words, you brainless lump. Just go ahead and tell him my name, why don't you?" Jerin colored when he realized what he had let slip.

"Pleased to meet you, Pol. Please, come in and make yourself more comfortable. I am not sure how much time we have, but you may as well be comfortable in the meantime."

"I'll stay right here. Unless I can go back to the dorm. I'd be comfortable there."

"I'd rather you didn't," said Levifid, "Not right now. Later, perhaps." He came over to where Nessa waited and Jerin stood, folding himself into a chair that was too small for him. Pol stayed where he was, but did not try to leave.

Levifid eyed Jerin. "I don't believe I was mistaken earlier today, but you had two fibers connecting you to your friends at that time. I can only see one, now." He looked at Pol. "You were sitting next to Jerin at the time in the Grand Hall, so it was not easy to see but it was there, if not as obvious at the one that was evidently connected to Nessa, here."

"How do you know that? I wasn't anywhere near Jerin today. I wasn't in the Hall at all," Pol lied.

"I know that because I have the memory of a dominus and I made a point of looking at you closely once I had ascertained that there was a connection," Levifid said matter-of-factly. "There is no chance that I am wrong about this."

"A domi-what?" asked Jerin.

"Dominus," said Levifid. "It's a long story and involves science and technology that you have no knowledge of. It will have to wait for another day. But then I believe you might have more of an appreciation for what I can do than just about any other person on this planet."

"Why do you say that?" asked Jerin. He fidgeted and shot a glance at Nessa.

"Because," said Levifid. "If I do this..." Nessa saw nothing, but Jerin ducked his head and flinched away from nothing that she could see. "...you can see it. Probably can interact with it, too. You have been exposed to Sicaria's Artifact. Not in the wrong way, the way the priests have been doing it for who knows how long, but in the right way. Maybe by accident, but it was done." Jerin sat down heavily. He was fortunate that there was a cushioned chair behind him.

"Let me guess. You found yourself facing the Artifact. Not for any official reason, because I understand the rules of the Order would forbid that. A childhood prank, perhaps? Or a dare? But you had cut yourself somehow. Your hand was bleeding. Maybe you reached under the sphere of the Artifact to see how it was floating there. You immediately had a flash of light, like your senses had been amplified beyond their limits. And then you probably lost consciousness. How am I doing?" Jerin just nodded dumbly.

"What happened next, Pol?" asked Levifid. Nessa noticed Pol jump at the mention of his name. He had been listening. "You were there, were you not? Were you the friend who dared him to do it? You seem the type."

"I didn't..." Pol started to protest, but then shut his mouth tight.

"Pol helped me, afterwards," said Jerin in a small voice. "I fell and hit my head. Was in the infirmary for a week." Levifid nodded.

"And the connection was made. Probably an involuntary action. Have you gained any control over the dark fibers?" Jerin shrugged.

"Nothing much." He glanced at Nessa, who had chided him only yesterday about not learning how to do anything with his talent. "I can... there are threads... fibers that just come along. I can snag them and let them go. Not good for much. Launched a few eggs from the roof of the Temple."

"But this afternoon there was a connection between you and Pol, here. And now there is not. Can you explain that?" Levifid asked.

"Pol wanted me to break it. We figured out that you could... the Trinity could see it. He wanted me to break it," Jerin repeated.

"And you did. Well, that is a significant step. That shows that you have more potential than I would have guessed," said Levifid.

"Wait," began Nessa. Her mind put the pieces together. "The bond to me, you could have broken it? You could have... and my family wouldn't have been hurt?" She felt a surge of anger.

"I didn't want to try," Jerin said. He said something about the energy of the bonds and how he had destroyed a weapons rack with them before, but she was barely listening.

"You could have?" said Nessa, standing up. "Do it now!" she yelled.

"Nessa, I don't think--" Jerin began, and Pol chimed in.

"It hurt like hell," he said from his place by the door. Jerin turned to look at him. Pol still stood as though he regretted being there, but he had half a grin on his face. "Like getting kicked by a mule. Might not be so eager to have it done a second time. I know I'm not."

Levifid's impassive face flinched slightly. "You released it from one end, allowing it to rebound?" he asked. Jerin nodded once. "You are lucky that Pol survived. The dark fibers, though invisible, are a cosmological construct, joining the universe together. They account for more of the universe than the everyday matter that you can see and feel, but they are untouchable by humans. Most humans," he corrected. "The energy in them, if released in an uncontrolled way, could have fatal effects. Nessa, do not be harsh on Jerin for not doing this to you. If the fiber had been snapped from a distance of a kilometer, you would not have survived." Jerin shot an apologetic look at Pol. "The correct way to do this would be to allow it to dissipate its energy, returning it to the zero point energy of the cosmos." Nessa was staring at Levifid without understanding what he had just said, and so were Jerin and Pol.

"Allow me to demonstrate." Levifid directed his attention to the space between Jerin and Nessa. Nessa imagined she felt a pressure against her breast, and then it was gone. She could not put words to it, but...

"There's something missing," said Nessa. "I thought... just for a bit, that i could feel something. And now it's gone."

"Intriguing," said Levifid. "How long has it been since you used the Artifact?" Nessa opened her mouth, but then remembered that that was something that was supposed to be a secret. "Don't worry, my dear. I had deduced this a while ago. I guess from the state of your hand that it's about a day or so. You appear to be developing the dark fiber capabilities at about the same rate as Darla and Violet did."

"Who?" asked Pol. "Someone else was foolish enough to do what these two have?"

"No, not exactly. They were compelled to take part in Sicaria's experiments, a very long time ago. I believe Violet was the fifth subject, and the first to come through alive and in possession of her mental faculties. Darla was the sixth."

"What? There was a chance Nessa could have died?" said Jerin, jumping to his feet.

"Not much chance of that, unless the Artifact had been damaged. I don't believe that any of the Order candidates died after that. They were certainly damaged, though. What happened to their minds and their sense of right and wrong was terrible to see. They were barely better than automatons until Darla could help them."

"Wait, the Order had this done to them? They could... sense these thread things?" asked Pol. He had come closer to the group, no longer standing by the door. "Did they use them to catapult eggs over walls, too?" He grinned when he said it. Nessa thought Pol's face was more accustomed to grinning than sulking.

"More than that. They were lethal fighters. Melior taught them many of the techniques he knew, and he is the most experienced fighter among the Trinity. Of all the domini who came to Tero, actually."

"Fighting?" asked Jerin. "how do you fight with these... you called them dark threads?"

"Dark fibers," corrected Levifid. "There were only four generations of domini on Earth before we came here to Tero." He held up a long hand when Pol started to ask a question. "There are many ways that those generations invented to fight with the fibers, especially the second generation. Allow me to demonstrate... as gently as I can."

There was a pause, and then Nessa saw Jerin jump, then Pol. Finally, she felt a gentle rap on her upper left arm. It was as though someone had hit her gently with a thumb-thick stick. She rubbed at the spot. It was not painful, but it was spooky that something she could not see could do that to her.

"Such bludgeoning can be lethally hard," said Levifid, and suddenly one of the cushions on the long lounging-chair lifted into the air. Then it exploded in a cloud of feathers. The bang of the impact made Nessa flinch. The remains of the cushion floated down, leaving a carpet of white fluff on the parquet floor. "And the nature of fibers is that they are infinitely thin. You can cut with them, better than any razor." The cloth exterior of the cushion floated back up, and was drawn tight, again by nothing that Nessa could see. Without any ripping sound at all, the cloth parted, leaving two equal pieces flapping. They drifted through the air, one landing on Nessa's lap, and Jerin catching the other.

Nessa held up the cloth. The dark patterned velvet was tattered from its original explosion, but the fresh cut was finer than any pair of tailor's scissors could have managed. Nessa held the edge up close to her eyes, and she could not see any fraying.

"And that is only mechanical advantage. One of the most horrific things from the wars of the second generation was the firestorm. I will not demonstrate this, not unless I wished to completely turn the city to glass. The walls probably would survive. Reas did a fine job of making them."

"I think I understand. Not the firestorm, but I understand. I think I saw what you did. It was too fast, but I think I saw," said Jerin. His face was wondering as he fingered the remains of the cushion.

There was a knock at the doors. Instantly, eveyone froze, even Levifid. "Come," said Levifid. The doors opened, and a Temple acolyte, barely more than eight years old, stepped in. He was one that had a round face and was suffering from gaps in his teeth where the baby ones had fallen out. He had an adorable lisp as he spoke, Nessa thought.

"Dominus Melior, Highest of the Order, commands that you attend him, Dominus Levifid," he said in a high voice.

Without missing a beat, Levifid replied to the boy. "I will attend Melior presently. Thank you for the message." He waited for the boy to bow himself out of the doors and let them close before speaking again.

"I am very much afraid that Melior has heard of what has happened this evening." He fixed first Jerin and then Nessa with a stare. It was not angry. If Nessa had to put an emotion to it, it would have been sad. She got the feeling that this strange, tall man was sad much of the time. "If he discovers what we have discussed tonight, I think you will all die."

"Wait, what?" said Pol. He was the first to digest what Levifid had said. "I thought you and he were on the same team. Why would he want them dead?" He pointed to Jerin and Nessa. "You said that the Order used to treat all of their members this way."

Levifid looked again from face to face to face. He wished that the Artifact had granted the mental capacities of the domini and not just the ability to sense dark fibers. It was so frustrating that those affected should have the dangerous capabilities and none of the intellectual merits. These three young people, who were no doubt bright, and seemingly as well-educated as any in this time and place, were no domini.

"I would like to have the time to explain everything to you. But I have very limited time," he said. "Let me say that I do not know the full mind of Melior. But upon discovering that the Order did not have the secret of the Artifact any more, was relieved and declared that no more fiber-wielders should be made. I judge that to mean that he will guard the ability jealously. I would not put it past him to eliminate me." He cringed inwardly at letting this secret be voiced, but it felt good to say it. The faces of the two boys and girl were shocked. He should have expected that.

"The Five are *of* the power, and but not *wielders* of it. They will be better servants, and willing followers without reaming out their minds first. With the Trinity and the Five to support us, I think that Melior means to first assert dominance over Arnath, and then follow that with consuming Rhed. I assume you two heard what he said in the Grand Hall today."

Jerin and Pol exchanged glances. "I was more focused on Punisher and Death, sir," he said, blushing. "I was fascinated by what I could see."

"And he wouldn't stop whispering stuff in my ear," added Pol. Levifid felt like the human response at this time was to sigh. He'd never tried doing that. It might feel good.

"Suffice to say, you are in danger, and I don't know what to do with you," he said. "You are too valuable to end up dismembered in Sicaria's lab."

"You're joking," said Nessa. Levifid only shook his head. He stood and moved towards the door. He looked back at the three young people, all staring at him.

"I suggest that you not be here when I return. To be here would be unsafe."

"Where should we go?" asked Jerin.

"I'm not saying you should go anywhere. I wouldn't suggest telling me about it. Anything I know might end up being known by Melior. I have seen the depths to which he will go to inflict pain on those who wrong him. I don't want to suffer the same fate as Reas. I want you all to have a long life, but I'd rather not know where you are living it. I tried playing god a long time ago and failed." He turned and the door opened before him. "I wish you all well. You will grow to be a powerful force on this planet, I hope it will be for good."

He left and started through the halls of the Temple, trying to remember the route to the quarters that Melior kept.

"What did that mean?" asked Pol. "Is he crazy? One second he's showing you everything, and the next he's out the door telling us he never wants to see us again."

Jerin was silent. Pol was telling the truth. In a few minutes, Levifid had shown him more of what was possible than he could have imagined. But it was only a glimpse.

"We should leave," said Nessa. She rose from her seat, wincing slightly.

"You are okay?" asked Jerin. Nessa nodded.

"Leave? To where?" asked Pol. "Back to the dorms?"

"I don't think that would be enough if Levifid doesn't want to see us again," said Jerin.

"He could have been more specific," retorted Pol. "But if he wants us out of the Temple, wasn't that the plan earlier this evening? There's only one reason we're back here, and it seems as though we weren't even needed." Pol jerked a thumb in Nessa's direction.

Jerin tried to think. He had seen only a small part of what Levifid could do. Even opening and closing the doors had been a demonstration of something that he could not dream of doing. *Or could I?*

"If I leave, who's going to teach me how to do those things?" He said it half-aloud. When he realized that both Nessa and Pol were looking at him, Jerin cleared his throat. "I know you guys can't see what he was doing, but he demonstrated a heck of a lot of things that are possible. I want him to teach me." He stabbed a finger at the doors that Levifid had departed through.

"He said he didn't want..." began Pol, but Nessa spoke.

"You have a good point, Jerin." She shivered. "I think... I think he was telling me that the Artifact was working on me, changing me. Before you guys got here. Soon... soon I'll be able to see the things that Jerin can. That's what he meant." She moved to stand in front of Jerin, and held out a hand. Jerin took it. "There's no one else who knows what any of this really means. Jerin's right: he told us more in a few minutes than we even understand. He was there. He was there and saw the Apocalypse. He knew Reas the Damned." Nessa clicked her tongue in frustration. "I wish I'd had the sense to ask more questions. Only now I understand what he represents."

"Yeah, he's a god and represents the Trinity," said Pol. "And that's a great cue for us to make ourselves scarce. I remember my dad once said to me: 'Pol, if you ever meet a god, run the other way'."

"Pol, we're trying to be serious," said Jerin.

"So am I!" Pol said emphatically. "You heard what he said. Dismembered. Why are we even still here?"

"He could teach us, Pol," said Jerin.

"It sounds like two thirds of the Trinity would rather kill us. And it also sounds like the one-third of the Trinity who wants to protect us can't do that. Which is more important to you? Doing fancy things with these fibers, or continuing to breathe?"

Jerin wanted to argue further, but he knew that his friend was right. He didn't pretend to understand the ways that the Trinity thought. They were so far beyond him that he was like a cat trying to understand the Words.

"Where do we go?" Jerin asked.

"Let's start by getting out of the bloody dominus' apartment, first, okay?" said Pol.

"Pol's right," said Nessa. Pol looked surprised.

"Okay," Jerin sighed. He led the trio to the doors and opened them.

The apartment's doors opened to an intersection of hallways. Straight ahead was deeper into the Temple, leading to an archway and beyond that a set of stairs down to the central facilities of the complex. To the left lay many of the quarters of the most important priests in the Order. Some of them were empty now, thanks to the executions the previous day. To the right was the direction to the dorms and to the classrooms. Jerin and Pol both turned to the right, but Nessa stopped.

"I'm not going anywhere until I've seen if my father is okay," said Nessa.

"He's fine," said Pol. "You heard the instructions that he gave to them. He's probably wrapped up tight and warm with his feet up and a hot cup of tea. Now let's get going."

"No, I'll catch up," said Nessa.

"If you have to catch up, we're not waiting for you," said Pol, taking another step in the direction of the dorms.

"Pol, she thought her father might have died this evening. She needs to see him." Jerin was torn, standing almost halfway between Nessa and Pol. Pol just started laughing. It did not sound like a real laugh.

"We are going to have living gods searching for us any minute now. And you want to go to the medic hall? You might as well just go knock on Sicaria's door. It'll end up the same, and you won't waste anyone's time. Not even mine."

"Pol, we're going to need more supplies. Do you think that you can get anything from the kitchens without being spotted?"

"She's coming with us, I take it?" Pol said. He sounded resigned.

"Yes, and unlike us, she's not packed for it. Can you do it?"

"Yeah, yeah. At the chute?"

"Pol, I'm counting on you," said Jerin.

"I said I'd do it. Midnight." With that, he turned and in a few moments had turned a corner and was gone.

"He'll do it," Jerin said to Nessa.

"If you say so. Let's move."

Three times, Jerin and Nessa had to hide. Voices alerted them to small groups of two or three priests moving through the halls. "Are they looking o for us?" Nessa breathed into Jerin's ear. The sensation shot up his spine when she did that. It was distracting.

"I don't know. I don't think so," he said. This time they had had to duck into the space in behind a wall hanging that showed a version of Melior commanding the Order forward into battle. Lightning bolts were clutched in his hand, raised over his head. They knew this hanging. The space they were in led to a small door about the size of a child. Beyond that was a space under the floorboards of the abbey above. Then there were other ways out from there. It was just part of their map of the Temple. "They can't be searching for us, they'd rouse the acolytes for that. I don't know why they are out so late."

They waited. The priests were still in the corridor.

"Pol's been a good friend to me," Jerin whispered in the darkness. Nessa was next to him, a barely distinguishable shadow.

"I know," said Nessa.

"You know that there are never any girls in the Temple. Well, except you. He hasn't known any."

"He's out of the Temple more than you are," said Nessa.

Jerin knew that was true. He didn't like it that Pol was always dismissive of Nessa.

"The Words and the other teachings of the priests..." he began.

"I know them, Jerin. I have to keep my hair covered at all times. I have to keep my head down when helping in the shop or out on the street. I know. It takes a strong man like my dad to see past all that." She let the criticism of Pol remain unsaid, but Jerin picked it up.

The priests passed them by, and Jerin and Nessa emerged from their hiding. They kept moving.

The doors to the medic hall were open. They always were, unless there was an epidemic. The lights were low, showing two long rows of white-sheeted beds, one along each wall. Only four lamps were lit, all turned down as low as they could be. The brightest light was coming from the door at the far end of the hall. There, the night medic was passing time, alert in case there was any sort of emergency. Only five of the beds had occupants, and the sounds of sleep came from them all.

"Looks like all the excitement is over," whispered Jerin. Nessa nodded, and then slipped into the hall. Jerin followed, one eye watching Nessa and the other paying attention to the light from the door ahead of them. He didn't think he would get in trouble being here, but Nessa would be severely punished. Again. Nessa slowed, and then ducked between two beds. In one lay a man, and in the other, a woman. The two beds beyond held what must have been Nessa's two sisters. Nessa went to her knees, putting a hand to her father's forehead. It was covered with bandages. One eye was covered as well. A sling immobilized his right arm. He did not stir at the touch.

"Father," she whispered. There was no reaction. Nessa moved her hands to hold her father's hand, lying on top of the thin covers. Still, there was no reaction from him. But the woman in the bed behind her woke.

"Who? Nessa?" the older woman said, sitting up and clutching her own cover to her chest. Jerin was not a good judge, but she seemed to resemble Nessa closely, with more gray than brown in her hair and lines on her face. She also was quite plump, with an indication of a large chest partly hidden behing the cover.

*Note: Jerin met her earlier this evening.*

"Oh, Mom," Nessa whispered. She turned and threw herself into her mother's arms, being held and rocked. "Is he going to be okay?"

"I don't know, pumpkin," said her mother, tears leaking down her cheeks. Her eyes finally spotted Jerin standing there in his Order robes. She gasped, and clutched Nessa protectively, staring at Jerin angrily.

"'What to you want?" she said. Nessa turned her head to see what was the matter, and saw her mother staring down Jerin.

"Mom, he's with me. This is Jerin N'patri. I've spoken of him before." Her mother's arms relaxed a little, but she didn't take her eyes off of Jerin.

"They came and found us at our place. I'd already put your father up in the bed and was putting some coal on when they came in. Said they had been told to bring us to the Temple. I didn't want them to move him." Her stare finally broke, and she looked at her husband instead. "Brought us all here, in a cart. Whisked us in here and looked us over. The rest of us were fine, mostly. But they said that one of the big bosses told them to." her whispered voice dropped even further when she said that.

"Yes, I told him about dad," said Nessa, freeing herself from her mother's grasp.

"You did?" Nessa's mother but her hands to her mouth, her eyes wide.

"What did they say about dad?" Nessa asked, turning to examine him again. He still had not stirred.

"Said he'd taken a thump to the head, as if I didn't know that already. Said he might have a cracked skull. Felt all around, squeezing like that." She mimicked the movements of the medics with her hands. "Managed to get something down his throat. If it was the same stuff they gave the girls and me, it's better that he didn't wake up."

Jerin was starting to look nervously in the direction of the lit door. So far, their whispered conversation hadn't brought the medic to the door, but it couldn't last forever. "Nessa, we need to go," he whispered.

"Go? I thought you were talking to the big boss," said Mari.

"Levifid," corrcted Nessa. "We were. Mom, this isn't going to be easy, but... I'm going away. I'm in danger."

"What?" said Mari, her voice rising above a whisper. Immediately everyone froze and turned to look at the door. They waited for several breaths before relaxing and turning away. "What do you mean, going away? You're not old enough to go anywhere. You go back to the our home this instant. You see what you can do about the door. It's still hanging open. Probably getting robbed blind while we are all here. In fact, I'll come with you." She made a motion to flip the cover back and get out of bed, but Nessa put one hand on her mother's shoulder and she stopped.

"There's no point in me going home. They will find me there."

"They? They who?"

"The Trinity, Mom. I heard it straight from Levifid's mouth. Sicaria wants me. It's the reason that she came to our shop. It's the reason that Dad is like that." Ness a gestured at her still father.

"That's ridiculous," said her mother, but there wasn't much heat in it. Nessa did not reply. She just waited for her mother to stop and realize the truth. But she was not willing to give up without a fight.

"You can't leave the City. There's nowhere to go. You've got a third cousin that lives ten kilometers west, but he's barely got a roof over his head and a dirt floor. You can't go there."

Nessa caught Jerin's eyes. "I don't know where I'm going, Mom. Or when I'll be back." Her whispered voice caught as she said the last. Jerin could she see her trying to fight back tears.

"Why would the Trinity care about you? I'm sorry dear, I didn't mean it the way it sounded, but why?"

"It's a long story, Mom. But someday, you will know. I... I'm special. So is Jerin here." She indicated Jerin, and her mother looked suspiciously at him.

"Special? Other than that hair and those eyes, I don't see anything special."

"We are. And one day... I... I hope..." Nessa's words failed her.

"We will be back, ma'am," Jerin said. "We learned a thing or two tonight. We will be back. I promise."

"You'll look after her?" Nessa gave her mom one last hug.

"I'll look after him, Mom." She grinned, and her mother rolled her eyes.

"Honestly, I don't know where I went wrong with you, girl," she said.

"Make sure Dad gets better, okay Mom?"

"I will. He'll be dancing by Rose Day." Nessa got to her feet. She bent quickly and gave her father a quick peck on the cheek and then straightened. She took her Mom's extended hand and gave it a squeeze and then they were moving as quickly as they could without making noise. They retraced their stpes out of the medic hall. Jerin spared one look back and saw the dark outline of Nessa's mom still sitting up in her bed, one hand half-raised in farewell. He didn't know if Nessa looked back. When he turned, he saw her several paces ahead already. He hustled to catch up, and when he expected them to take a right at the first intersection, she turned left.

"What is it?" asked Jerin.

"I want to go to the Library first," she said.

"Nessa, time is tight," said Jerin. "We need to make ourselves scarce."

"If we're leaving here, I want to grab something."

Jerin just looked at Nessa, waiting for her to speak.

"Some of the things Levifid said. The names. I remember one of the books that I read years ago. I think there were some that seemed familiar."

"Are you sure?" asked Jerin. There was a side passage that had a concealed passage that led to the roof not too far that way. It would be the easiest way to get to the laundry and back out of the Temple again.

"No, of course not. But I think our biggest danger isn't Sicaria, it's ignorance. If I could have my way, I'd tie a rope around Levifid and not let him go until he explained himself. But if all we have is a clue or two, I'll take it."

"I'll go with you," Jerin said to Nessa. "We can still meet Pol before..." he tried to remember what the last bell was that he had heard. It was late. His mind felt like it was slowing with a want of sleep. "...midnight.

Jerin fell into step behind Nessa. Her back was stiff as she walked. She didn't say anything, and Jerin didn't ask where was going. Jerin could only imagine what she was feeling. So many times growing up, he had tried to imagine what it was like to have a mother and a father and a family. He didn't get much of a chance in the Temple among the all-male priests and the boys of the Order. There were rare occasions when one or both parents of an acolyte would come to the Temple, but never farther than the Entrance Hall. It occurred to Jerin that this was the closest he had ever been to a mother, since he'd been brought to the Temple as a baby.

They moved quickly. The corridors of the Temple were dim with the lamps turned down low. It was not long before Jerin and Nessa reached the familiar ways that they had been exploring since they were both children.

The light in the dark corridor rose a little as they approached the alcoves above the Library.

"Do you know where the book is?" Jerin asked. The Library was huge, and they didn't have a lot of time. They reached the alcoves, and the tops of the stacks stood with canyons of darkness between them. Canyons full of the accumulated knowledge of the last thousand years or more.

"I do. You can stay here if you want. I won't be long." She sat on the edge of the bookshelf that rose to the level of the alcove and swung her legs over, looking for toeholds on the shelf below.

"I'm coming," said Jerin. There was no way he was going to wait up here. He would go crazy waiting.

They scrambled down with the ease of long practice, making as little noise as they could. As soon as they reached the floor level, Nessa headed right, along the wall, in the direction of the main entrance to the Library.

The Library did not have an indexing system. As Jerin had grown older and been allowed access to more of the books in the stacks, he had found out that the priests who oversaw the library were the only ones who knew where any of the books were. They had only read a small fraction of the books themselves and so most of the pages in this enormous collection were unknown to all. Jerin understood that the records keepers tried to pass along what they knew, in the form of notes and other tables of contents, but they probably knew less than one in one hundred of the books.

Nessa and Jerin had discovered much in their raids. Nessa had probably taken and read as many books as the librarians had. If she knew where the book was, she might be the only one. She turned into one of the tightest avenues between the stacks and stopped. Jerin remained in the main passage, trying to keep watch.

"I remember it: it was blue," Nessa muttered. "It's so hard to see in the dark, though." She was running her hand over the spines, looking closely. "It was in the ancient tongue. I didn't realize it until I got it home. I barely know any of that."

"How do you know the names were in it?" Jerin whispered.

Nessa made a little sound of disgust. "I can work out the words. The names are phonetic."

"You remember that?" asked Jerin.

"You know how hard I've had to work for every book I've swiped from here," said Nessa, continuing to search the spines of the tomes in front of her. "I read and re-read every one, and when I found that I couldn't read this one... a-ha!" She gripped a book and slid it from the shelf.

The book could have been blue, but in the dim light, all Jerin could see was that it was dark-colored. The writing on the cover was in a white ink that was nearly indecipherable, and the cover itself looked like it was flaking away. It wasn't a large book, maybe as thick as Jerin's thumb, and small enough that it would fit into a pocket on his robe. Nessa opened it, putting it so close to her trying to read in the dim light that her nose bumped it.

"I think it's the right one," she said. "Need to get under some better light..." she was looking up. The main open area of the library had the brightest lights, and at night it was the only place where there was enough light. She led the way.

They were almost out of the passage between the shelves when there was a sound. It was a heavy noise, and one that Jerin knew very well. It was the sound of the main doors of the library moving on its hinges. The door's hinges were well-oiled but there was a distinct sound. The doors themselves were massive and made of wood a full handspan thick.

Jerin did not need to tell Nessa to stop. They both froze. Jerin's heart suddenly seemed noisy in his ears and he tried to control his breathing so that he could listen for any other sounds. Nessa started to turn and gesture to return the way they had come, when there was another sound.

This sound, Jerin did not recognize. It sounded like something heavy sliding on the floor, like someone was dragging something. It was not a loud sound, but it was clearly audible. Jerin tried to remember exactly where they were in the library. They were only about four or five rows of shelves from the doors. If someone was coming into the library, it would only be moments before they would be able to see them. They were in the darkness, but Jerin cursed his bright white acolyte's robe. They needed to move, and quickly.

Jerin tried to catch Nessa's eye to gesture to her that they should retreat, but then the girl turned and took two tiptoe steps in the other direction. Sliding the book into her scrip, she pressed herself against the left bookshelf and slowly stuck her head out. She jerked and then slowly brought her head back.

There was a sense of urgency in her movements as she carefully stepped back from the end of the passage and rejoined Jerin. She came close and put her lips to Jerin's ear.

"Serpent," was all she said.

Jerin froze, but then Nessa was pulling away and slid by him, moving quickly. Jerin winced at the sounds her dress made as she moved. He followed, sweating.

Serpent. One of the Five. Jerin had not seen this one yet, but he had heard descriptions from Pol. Of the Five, Serpent was the one that gripped Jerin with a visceral terror. Shade, Death, Punisher and Crawler were all bad enough, but the very idea of Serpent terrified Jerin.

As he moved, Jerin tried to sense any dark fibers that might be a part of the crafting of Serpent, like he could Punisher and especially Death. Whether it was the panic or that there was nothing to sense, Jerin failed. He didn't dare look back. In moments, Jerin was sure that Serpent would see his bright white robe in the shadows of the books.

Jerin thought his lungs would burst from the effort to not pant loudly as he reached the end of the stacks and ducked around the end. He stumbled to a stop when he found Nessa there, no longer moving. She put a steadying hand out, with her finger on her lips. Jerin froze again.

The sound of Serpent moving in the Library was still there. The large stacks of books acted as huge sound baffles, muting noises, but the hard ceiling far above was echoing the sounds to them. Nessa was turning her head and moving around trying to localize the sound. Jerin tried to do the same, but he was terrified of making any noise at all.

Nessa came close again, putting her cheek against Jerin's. "I think he's moved up the middle, past us," she whispered in his ear. "We should slip out the doors." Jerin jerked away to look at Nessa. Her oval face was luminous in the dim light, and her eyes were large and showing fear, but also resolve. She put a hand up to pull Jerin's head close again.

"If we climb up and out, he'll hear us for sure. This will work."

Jerin shook his head, but Nessa brushed her lips on his cheek in a fleeting kiss. She grabbed his crippled hand and gave it a quick squeeze before leading the way in the opposite direction.

She followed the wall of the Library until she reached the corner, where they needed to turn. The Library doors were not far from the end of these shelves. Maybe half a dozen paces. Quietly, they slipped along. The books in the shelves were irregular shapes, with larger volumes and smaller volumes mixed together. They threatened to pull and catch. It seemed to take forever to make their way to the end of the shelves, and yet was over too quickly Jerin dreaded what was next.

Nessa looked around the last books, carefully extending only enough for one eye before pulling back. She motioned for Jerin to come look. He shook his head no, but when Nessa stared at him with one eyebrow raised, Jerin came forward. His eyes were drawn to the doors. The farther one was open. Only a few strides to cross, but they seemed like kilometers.

Reluctantly, he inched forward until he was as far as he could go without being seen. Not daring to breathe, Jerin craned his neck forward. More and more of the library came into view: the stacks of books on the opposite side of the room, reaching up higher than three men standing on each other's shoulders, the long tables in the middle of the room where the priests and acolytes would study, the map cases halfway down the room, their long, flat drawers all closed. And finally, Jerin saw what he dreaded. The room was not bright but compared to the dark where he and Nessa were hiding, it seemed like noonday.

Serpent was there. Jerin knew he should stop staring but he could not.

The part of him that was easiest to see was the torso of a well-muscled man, bare except for some leather straps that crisscrossed his back and looped his arms. If one were only to glance and see this much, perhaps the lack of a shirt would be the first thing noticed. Then perhaps that the man was short for the width of his shoulders. But that would lead one's gaze downwards to where legs would be expected.

Just as Pol had described, below the waist, Serpent was not human. A long, dark serpentine body curled under him and trailed back. As he moved, the scaly underside of his body scraped against the floor, making that dragging sound.

Seeing Serpent for the first time did not relieve Jerin's visceral dread. If anything, the lively way that the snakelike undercarriage twisted and coiled made Jerin want to run screaming. There were few snakes anywhere in Victoria, but this made Jerin aware for the first time that he was afraid of them.

He could not help but let out a gasp. He saw Serpent freeze and start turning his head, trying to pinpoint the source of the sound. Nessa's hand clapped over Jerin's mouth and she pulled him back.

Jerin let himself be pulled. He stood, shaking in the shadows. He watched as Nessa replaced him at the lookout. The horror of seeing something like that had completely unnerved Jerin. Had he been human? He must have been. The thought that Sicaria could have done that to a human, transforming them so fundamentally, reminded Jerin of how little he knew about what one could do with this gift.

Nessa held up a fist. She extended three fingers.

She retracted one finger. Two. Three.

She started moving towards the open door. Jerin did not.

He watched Nessa moving silently, slipping towards the door and away from Serpent.

Away from Serpent. That thought unfroze Jerin. He blinked and was surprised that Nessa was no longer in sight. She had made it out.

He took a step and then another. He thought about Serpent, but he kept his eyes on the door as he moved. He felt clumsy and wooden.

Halfway to the door, he heard a shout. It was a coarse, grating voice but recognizably human. The idle thought came to Jerin that he would have expected Serpent to make a hissing sound.

Jerin started running. There was a following shout but Jerin paid it no mind. He felt a sense of relief that was physical when one step crossed the threshold of the library. Nessa was there and he heard her fall in behind him. They were pelting as fast as they could go. If anyone was to appear in front of them, there would be no way to stop or to hide.

Jerin was not even trying to find a side route back to the dorms and the laundry. It was the middle of the night and everyone should have been in bed anyways.

Behind them, they heard a crash as the other door to the Library was wrenched open. There was no question that they were being pursued. Jerin kept running.

## Into the Great Wide Open

When Jerin and Nessa burst into the laundry where Pol was waiting, he looked up with a look of annoyance. He was pacing back and forth, his and Jerin's packs against a wall. There was a third pack there now. Jerin didn't know where his friend had gotten it, but he was glad to see it.

The annoyance melted from Pol's face when he saw that they were running. Jerin didn't know what was on his face, but Pol's went white.

"What is it? What happened?" he hissed.

"No time," said Nessa, panting from the run. Jerin was out of breath. He did not do a lot of running in the Temple. A stitch in his side was threatening to make him collapse.

Pol turned and picked up the smallest pack and tossed it to Nessa. He then grabbed his own. Jerin limped and picked up his pack.

There was no sound of pursuit, but they needed to hurry.

"We need to get out of the City before they close the gates," he said, sucking in air.

"Are you going to make it?" asked Pol.
