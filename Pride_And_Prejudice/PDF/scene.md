<mark title="Sentence v. difficult to read" style="background-color: #e4b9b9">Not all that Mrs. Bennet, <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">however</mark>, with the assistance of her five daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley.</mark> <mark title="Sentence v. difficult to read" style="background-color: #e4b9b9">They attacked him in various ways—with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all, and they were at last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour, Lady Lucas.</mark> Her report was <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">highly</mark> favourable. Sir William had <mark title="Passive voice" style="background-color: #c4ed9d">been delighted</mark> with him. <mark title="Sentence difficult to read" style="background-color: #f7ecb5">He was <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">quite</mark> young, <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">wonderfully</mark> handsome, <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">extremely</mark> agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party.</mark> Nothing could be more delightful! <mark title="Sentence difficult to read" style="background-color: #f7ecb5">To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">very</mark> <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">lively</mark> hopes of Mr. Bingley’s heart <mark title="Passive voice" style="background-color: #c4ed9d">were entertained</mark>.</mark>

<mark title="Sentence v. difficult to read" style="background-color: #e4b9b9">“If I can but see one of my daughters <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">happily</mark> settled at Netherfield,” said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, “and all the others <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">equally</mark> <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">well</mark> married, I shall have nothing to wish for.”</mark>

In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet’s visit, and sat about ten minutes with him in his library. <mark title="Sentence difficult to read" style="background-color: #f7ecb5">He had entertained hopes of <mark title="Passive voice" style="background-color: #c4ed9d">being admitted</mark> to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">much</mark>; but he saw <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">only</mark> the father.</mark> <mark title="Sentence difficult to read" style="background-color: #f7ecb5">The ladies were <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">somewhat</mark> more fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he wore a blue coat, and rode a black horse.</mark>

<mark title="Sentence v. difficult to read" style="background-color: #e4b9b9">An invitation to dinner was <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">so</mark>on afterwards dispatched; and <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">already</mark> had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all.</mark> <mark title="Sentence difficult to read" style="background-color: #f7ecb5">Mr. Bingley <mark title="Passive voice" style="background-color: #c4ed9d">was obliged</mark> to be in town the following day, and, <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">consequently</mark>, unable to accept the honour of their invitation, etc.</mark> Mrs. Bennet <mark title="Passive voice" style="background-color: #c4ed9d">was <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">quite</mark> disconcerted</mark>. <mark title="Sentence v. difficult to read" style="background-color: #e4b9b9">She could not imagine what business he could have in town <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">so</mark> <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">so</mark>on after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never settled at <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">Netherfield</mark> as he ought to be.</mark> <mark title="Sentence v. difficult to read" style="background-color: #e4b9b9">Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his <mark title="Passive voice" style="background-color: #c4ed9d">being gone</mark> to London <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">only</mark> to get a large party for the ball; and a report <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">so</mark>on followed that Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.</mark> <mark title="Sentence v. difficult to read" style="background-color: #e4b9b9">The girls grieved over such a number of ladies, but <mark title="Passive voice" style="background-color: #c4ed9d">were comforted</mark> the day before the ball by hearing, that <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">instead</mark> of twelve he brought <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">only</mark> six with him from London—his five sisters and a cousin.</mark> And when the party entered the assembly room it consisted of <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">only</mark> five altogether—Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man.

Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women, with an air of decided fashion. <mark title="Sentence v. difficult to read" style="background-color: #e4b9b9">His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">merely</mark> looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">soon</mark> drew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year.</mark> <mark title="Sentence v. difficult to read" style="background-color: #e4b9b9">The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">much</mark> handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he <mark title="Passive voice" style="background-color: #c4ed9d">was looked</mark> at with great admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud; to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his friend.</mark>

<mark title="Sentence v. difficult to read" style="background-color: #e4b9b9">Mr. Bingley had <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">so</mark>on made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room; he was <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">lively</mark> and unreserved, danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">so</mark> early, and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield.</mark> Such amiable qualities must speak for themselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! <mark title="Sentence v. difficult to read" style="background-color: #e4b9b9">Mr. Darcy danced <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">only</mark> <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">once</mark> with Mrs. Hurst and <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">once</mark> with Miss Bingley, declined <mark title="Passive voice" style="background-color: #c4ed9d">being introduced</mark> to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room, speaking <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">occasionally</mark> to one of his own party.</mark> His character <mark title="Passive voice" style="background-color: #c4ed9d">was decided</mark>. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">again</mark>. <mark title="Sentence v. difficult to read" style="background-color: #e4b9b9">Amongst the most violent <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">again</mark>st him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of his general behaviour <mark title="Passive voice" style="background-color: #c4ed9d">was sharpened</mark> into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters.</mark>

<mark title="Sentence v. difficult to read" style="background-color: #e4b9b9">Elizabeth Bennet had <mark title="Passive voice" style="background-color: #c4ed9d">been obliged</mark>, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been standing near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend to join it.</mark>

“Come, Darcy,” said he, “I must have you dance. I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">much</mark> better dance.”

“I <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">certainly</mark> shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I <mark title="Passive voice" style="background-color: #c4ed9d">am <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">particularly</mark> acquainted</mark> with my partner. At such an assembly as this it would be insupportable. <mark title="Sentence difficult to read" style="background-color: #f7ecb5">Your sisters <mark title="Passive voice" style="background-color: #c4ed9d">are engaged</mark>, and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with.”</mark>

“I would not be <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">so</mark> fastidious as you are,” cried Mr. Bingley, “for a kingdom! <mark title="Sentence difficult to read" style="background-color: #f7ecb5">Upon my honour, I never met with <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">so</mark> many pleasant girls in my life as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see uncommonly <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">pretty</mark>.”</mark>

“You are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,” said Mr. Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.

“Oh! She is the most beautiful creature I <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">ever</mark> beheld! But there is one of her sisters sitting down <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">just</mark> behind you, who is <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">very</mark> <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">pretty</mark>, and I dare say <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">very</mark> agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.”

<mark title="Sentence v. difficult to read" style="background-color: #e4b9b9">“Which do you mean?” and turning round he looked for a moment at Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">coldly</mark> said: “She is tolerable, but not handsome <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">enough</mark> to tempt me; I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who <mark title="Passive voice" style="background-color: #c4ed9d">are slighted</mark> by other men.</mark> You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting your time with me.”

Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth remained with no <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">very</mark> cordial feelings toward him. <mark title="Sentence difficult to read" style="background-color: #f7ecb5">She told the story, <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">however</mark>, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">lively</mark>, playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.</mark>

The evening <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">altogether</mark> passed off <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">pleasantly</mark> to the whole family. Mrs. Bennet had seen her eldest daughter <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">much</mark> admired by the Netherfield party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">twice</mark>, and she had <mark title="Passive voice" style="background-color: #c4ed9d">been distinguished</mark> by his sisters. Jane was as <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">much</mark> gratified by this as her mother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane’s pleasure. <mark title="Sentence v. difficult to read" style="background-color: #e4b9b9">Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">enough</mark> never to be without partners, which was all that they had <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">yet</mark> learnt to care for at a ball.</mark> <mark title="Sentence difficult to read" style="background-color: #f7ecb5">They returned, <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">therefore</mark>, in good spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they were the principal inhabitants.</mark> They found Mr. Bennet <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">still</mark> <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">up</mark>. <mark title="Sentence v. difficult to read" style="background-color: #e4b9b9">With a book he was <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">regardless</mark> of time; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations.</mark> <mark title="Sentence difficult to read" style="background-color: #f7ecb5">He had <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">rather</mark> hoped that his wife’s views on the stranger would <mark title="Passive voice" style="background-color: #c4ed9d">be disappointed</mark>; but he <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">soon</mark> found out that he had a different story to hear.</mark>

“Oh, my dear Mr. Bennet,” as she entered the room, “we have had a most delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there. Jane was <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">so</mark> admired, nothing could be like it. Everybody said how <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">well</mark> she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">quite</mark> beautiful, and danced with her <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">twice</mark>! <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">Only</mark> think of that, my dear; he <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">actually</mark> danced with her <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">twice</mark>! and she was the <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">only</mark> creature in the room that he asked a second time. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">so</mark> vexed to see him stand up with her! <mark title="Sentence difficult to read" style="background-color: #f7ecb5">But, <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">however</mark>, he did not admire her at all; <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">indeed</mark>, nobody can, you know; and he seemed <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">quite</mark> struck with Jane as she was going down the dance.</mark> <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">So</mark> he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and asked her for the two next. <mark title="Sentence v. difficult to read" style="background-color: #e4b9b9">Then the two third he danced with Miss King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">again</mark>, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the Boulanger—”</mark>

“If he had had any compassion for me,<mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">”</mark> cried her husband <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">impatiently</mark>, “he would not have danced half <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">so</mark> much! For God’s sake, say no more of his partners. Oh that he had sprained his ankle in the first dance!<mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">”</mark>

“Oh! my dear, I <mark title="Passive voice" style="background-color: #c4ed9d">am <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">quite</mark> delighted</mark> with him. He is <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">so</mark> <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">excessively</mark> hand<mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">so</mark>me! And his sisters are charming women. I never in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the lace upon Mrs. Hurst’s gown—”

Here she <mark title="Passive voice" style="background-color: #c4ed9d">was interrupted</mark> <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">again</mark>. Mr. Bennet protested <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">again</mark>st any description of finery. <mark title="Sentence v. difficult to read" style="background-color: #e4b9b9">She <mark title="Passive voice" style="background-color: #c4ed9d">was <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">therefore</mark> obliged</mark> to seek another branch of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.</mark>

<mark title="Sentence v. difficult to read" style="background-color: #e4b9b9">“But I can assure you,” she added, “that Lizzy does not lose <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">much</mark> by not suiting his fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at all worth pleasing.</mark> <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">So</mark> high and <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">so</mark> conceited that there was no enduring him! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">so</mark> <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">very</mark> great! Not hand<mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">so</mark>me <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">enough</mark> to dance with! I wish you had been there, my dear, to have given him one of your set-downs. I <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">quite</mark> detest the man.”
